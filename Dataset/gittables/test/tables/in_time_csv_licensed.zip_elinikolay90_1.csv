"Great hotel for relatively cheap price","Me and my girlfriend stayed in this hotel during the covid 19 scamdemic for 3 nights. The hotel receptionist Nick was super nice and funny! He even offered us super cheap upgrades for better rooms which we didn’t take because the standard room was just fine.
The breakfast option wasn’t so big.. no salads and selection of cheeses or other morning delicacies as other 4 stars hotels. Breakfast was on rooftop which made it a nice experience overall.
We payed 150€ per night which wasn’t super expensive but could have been a little cheaper considering the fact that the hotel was almost empty.
The shower in the room was ok. Not superb
The window in the room didn’t close completely so it was kinda noisy in the night abit and in the morning..
We had to pay for the water bottles nothing was for free.. overall experience was 7-10.
Best thing about the hotel was it’s location!! You literally walk out to onto streets full of food and shops which was super convenient!
Would recommend this hotel if you are looking for something not super expensive and central.","September 2020","Electra Metropolis Hotel","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10798588-Reviews-Electra_Metropolis_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","hotels","4.0","4.5"
"Best view around 6PM","Been there today 22th of September, costs 20€ per person above the age of 25.bif however you are below that age and posses a European passport you can go in for free! We came at 6PM the site closed at 7PM but it was still nice and enough time to see it all. Only thing is that we been told rudely by the staff “you cannot pose here” which was so out of place because the reason people go there is to also take pictures even though the site was almost empty.. So that was little uncomfortable. To see the sunset we exited and took a little walk to the hill to watch the sun goes down which was super nice! Although the place is little dirty and has a lot of trash there.. Worth visiting once.","September 2020","Acropolis","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","attractions","3.0","4.5"
