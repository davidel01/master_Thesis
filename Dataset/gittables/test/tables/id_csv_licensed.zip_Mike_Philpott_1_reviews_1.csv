Learn Creo and Apriori and you will be completely fine for the labs and the project.","04/06/2016","1","1.0","","3","","3.5","3.5","1","No","","1112","Yes","","A","","people","people"

There are in class assignments that are guaranteed 100% if you are in class, no tests, and the rest of the class is a lab.  In the lab you follow the book step by step.  The last four or so weeks of the semester are a group design project.  Lectures are somewhat dry but you have to tough it out for the assignment credit.","01/28/2015","1","1.0","","4","Sorta interested","3.5","3.5","1","Yes","","1112","Yes","","","","people","people"
