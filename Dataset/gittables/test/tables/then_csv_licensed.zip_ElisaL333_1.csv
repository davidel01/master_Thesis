"If you want your personal data private don’t stay here","I’ve stayed here a number of times over the years and this is absolutely no longer the hotel it used to be. Guests are required to check in on a kiosk which displays your personal data to anyone and everyone who is standing around. I ultimately spoke with the hotel manager who while nice suggested that I should stay elsewhere next time as the kiosks are here to stay.

I also paid for a recently renovated room, but the pictures will show how dirty and worn out a number of items were. And yes that is duct tape holding down the carpet. The doors and walls are dirty, and the shower is worse. Very disappointed. This has become a tired old hotel that isn’t interested in their customers.","October 2019","Harveys Lake Tahoe","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g46004-d142236-Reviews-Harveys_Lake_Tahoe-Stateline_Lake_Tahoe_Nevada_Nevada.html","Stateline, Nevada","hotels","1.0","4.0"

"Not worth the visit","Beautiful location and hotel but poor planning and customer service. I spent three nights at this hotel between work and family, and experienced multiple issues each day. Between rooms not being ready (past the checkin time), lunch reservations not ready when the restaurant was 1/2 empty, my door lock malfunctioning twice (resulting in my being locked out and having to wait over 30 minutes both times to get in), and most of the resort being closed due to four weddings (3 at the same time), it made the stay far less than expected. While the staff were friendly no apologies were offered and little was done to rectify the issue.

I had fond memories of previous visits in years past at this hotel. Definitely not going back.","September 2019","The Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32469-d226144-Reviews-The_Ritz_Carlton_Half_Moon_Bay-Half_Moon_Bay_California.html","Half Moon Bay, California","hotels","1.0","4.5"

One of our rooms was ""upgraded "" but it appeared that it had not been used in months as the sink, toilet and shower had issues in starting to work. Our room was consistently not made up for the size of our party (not enough towels and or bedding) even after request. The rooms were tired and minimally clean (could see the dirt and wear). The culmination of our stay was the hotel shuttle being over an hour late ( and not arriving) after spending 125 pounds for the service. They did arrange for two cars to take us, but we were over an hour later than we needed to be to the airport. Unfortunately the entire event was far more stressful than we would have desired and expected.

We were told that these were the only rooms they had, and they would happily move us to a smoking room if we wished, which we declined. One of the rooms was quite chilly so we went to turn on the heater, but heater had an ""out of order sign"" on it. We again called the front desk, and while they were friendly we were told that there was not anything they could do to assist us, as it was a Saturday night and they would not be able to fix it. Upon checking out, I brought our concerns up again, the clerk said that she was very sorry to hear about our experience, but offered nothing else.

"Disappointing","We took a family vacation to San Diego.

After venturing around town the. Next day, we were again unable to get into our room. This time it took them more than three hours to get into our room because they said the lock was broken.
