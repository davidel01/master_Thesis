"Famous pizza","Arrived at 320pm, got a number from the front, got into the place at 4pm, served at 420pm. Ordered margarita and marinara (the only choices).

It is one special pizza base.","October 2019","L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d1235237-Reviews-L_Antica_Pizzeria_da_Michele-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html","Naples, Italy","restaurants","4.0","4.0"
