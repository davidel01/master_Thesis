The New York skyline is also visible from the shore and that is breath taking too. The audio tour they have is very informative and adds to the experience. The ferry is very convenient and has good frequency. When you wait in the queue for your ferry, make sure you are in the right queue. There are separate queue for new York bound tour and New Jersey bound tour. It easy to get confused and reach a wrong destination. Ellis island is also covered in the ferry tour and it has a good canteen too. The gift shop at the monument has great stuff and you are sure to find something in your budget. We took the ferry from New Jersey and it’s has ample paid parking close to the ferry. The 9/11 monument at the New Jersey ferry station is worth visiting as well.","July 2019","Statue of Liberty","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d103887-Reviews-Statue_of_Liberty-New_York_City_New_York.html","New York City, New York","attractions","4.0","4.5"

"Awesome!!!!!","Went to the One Piece park inside the Tokyo Tower. There are several ticket purchase options. If you want to see the actual tower, you need to buy the tickets on the first floor-there are combo one piece and tower tickets. If you just want to see the One Piece park - get your tickets on the 3rd floor. You can choose just a park entrance ticket or an entrance ticket plus the live show. The park entrance tickets were 2300 yen. I believe 3300 for the ticket plus the show. The show comes on every 2 hours starting at noon.
I can't say the park itself was worth the money.. It was very interesting to see everything. It's fun to go once for experience sake. It's kind of like a museum with stations with games in between. We chose not to watch the show bc...no subs.","April 2019","Tokyo Tower","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14129730-d320047-Reviews-Tokyo_Tower-Shibakoen_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html","Shibakoen, Japan","attractions","4.0","4.0"
"Don’t miss this wonder!!!!","If you call yourself a tourist, don’t miss this wonder. Don’t forget the camel ride. Don’t go for horse option, camel ride is another world. Learn the technique to sit on a camel and you will be fine. Take drinks with you. Don’t buy anything from vendors selling cold drinks inside the pyramid area. They might sell you a Pepsi bottle for &100 and then a crowd will appear to support their claim. Always ask the price before touching anything in Cairo and Giza.","September 2019","Pyramids of Giza","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294202-d317746-Reviews-Pyramids_of_Giza-Giza_Giza_Governorate.html","Giza, Egypt","attractions","4.0","4.5"
"A view of history!!!","A view of history, for millenia, through the vision of Chinese artists. The works very between classical simplicity to the incredibly detailed. Restoration is an art in itself, and is performed with amazing attention to details.
The multi-story museum is artfully organized. Each of the many rooms tell a story. Large and small objects are presented with care and consideration.
Elevators and escalators provide easy wheelchair access.
The gift shop is large containing both inexpensive and exquisitely detailed glass and porcelain.
The entire facility is wheelchair accessible and that includes western style bathrooms.","August 2019","National Palace Museum","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g13806879-d321216-Reviews-National_Palace_Museum-Shilin_Taipei.html","Shilin, Taipei","attractions","4.0","4.0"
"Spectacular Experience!!","Wow. Wow. Wow. I would give unlimited stars if I could! I booked fast track for an evening view of London, and I was not disappointed. While fast track did cost more, me and my boyfriend were straight past the long line, searched and into a pod within six minutes of arriving. Well worth the extra money in my opinion. But the views? Simply breathtaking. Seriously, the pictures and videos don't do justice. It's so peaceful being that high up, yet you see the city still bustling below. The pod has so many clear windows for excellent photo opportunities and is spacious enough for many people inside without feeling claustrophobic. The pace was just right and not once did I feel uncomfortable. I've seen people saying this is a ""tourist trap"", but I couldn't disagree more. As a Brit myself, I can't recommend you do this attraction enough and hopefully it will shine a light onto why I'm raving about it so much. A truly unforgettable, spectacular experience","March 2019","London Eye","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d553603-Reviews-London_Eye-London_England.html","London, United Kingdom","attractions","4.0","4.5"
"Totally worth it!!!","I loved this place! One of my favorites places at Toronto. It's totally worth it! I loved the tunnel, you can see sharks and turtles over your head, it was a unique experience.

I would definitely come back if there's new sections or species.","April 2019","Ripley's Aquarium of Canada","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g155019-d5031404-Reviews-Ripley_s_Aquarium_of_Canada-Toronto_Ontario.html","Toronto, Canada","attractions","4.0","4.5"

It is recommended getting there early as it can get busier later in the day, plus it can take several hours if you decide to take your time.","June 2019","Skip the Line: Royal Ontario Museum Ticket","https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g155019-d11462089-Skip_the_Line_Royal_Ontario_Museum_Ticket-Toronto_Ontario.html","Toronto, Canada","activities","4.0","4.5"

"Very educational!!!","When in Manila, Philippines you should come stop to see Fort Santiago. If you like museums and history this is one stop for you. But even if you don’t, it’s one of the historical places you’ll come to see in the Philippines. You can spend a God’s half of the day here. Although, they are still in the process of restoring some spots, you can see that it has been maintained. The architectural structure and characteristics are still visible from back in the day.
Here at Fort Santiago you can take a tour guide, a ride on a horse carriage, have some food, and shop at their cute little stores. The staff are very friendly and the entrance fee is close to nothing when you convert to US Dollars. We really enjoyed our time here. Very educational. You can learn about the history of Jose Rizal ( a national hero). And see photographs of the past.","December 2018","Fort Santiago","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298573-d586732-Reviews-Fort_Santiago-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html","Luzon, Philippines","attractions","4.0","4.0"
"Great part of United States history!!","Great part of United States history in Philadelphia. It was commissioned from London in 1752. It has written in it “Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof"". It’s a free attraction but you may have to wait in line 30 minutes or so depending on what day and time you do. Weekdays and non-holidays it’s usually less busy. The park outside it’s also a nice area to relax and it’s proximity to Independence Hall it’s also nice since you can visit both.","February 2019","Liberty Bell Center","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60795-d104156-Reviews-Liberty_Bell_Center-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","attractions","4.0","4.5"
