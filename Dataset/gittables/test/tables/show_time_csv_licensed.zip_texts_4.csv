"4","A sizable amount of goodness-of-fit tests involving functional data have appeared in the last decade. We provide a relatively compact revision of most of these contributions, within the independent and identically distributed framework, by reviewing goodness-of-fit tests for distribution and regression models with functional predictor and either scalar or functional response.","1"
"5","Multiple imputation is increasingly used in dealing with missing data. While some conventional multiple imputation approaches are well studied and have shown empirical validity, they entail limitations in processing large datasets with complex data structures. Their imputation performances usually rely on expert knowledge of the inherent relations among variables. In addition, these standard approaches tend to be computationally inefficient for medium and large datasets. In this paper, we propose a scalable multiple imputation framework mixgb, which is based on XGBoost, bootstrapping and predictive mean matching. XGBoost, one of the fastest implementations of gradient boosted trees, is able to automatically retain interactions and non-linear relations in a dataset while achieving high computational efficiency. With the aid of bootstrapping and predictive mean matching, we show that our approach obtains less biased estimates and reflects appropriate imputation variability. The proposed framework is implemented in an R package misle. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.","1"

"8","Learning with neural networks relies on the complexity of the representable functions, but more importantly, the particular assignment of typical parameters to functions of different complexity. Taking the number of activation regions as a complexity measure, recent works have shown that the practical complexity of deep ReLU networks is often far from the theoretical maximum. In this work we show that this phenomenon also occurs in networks with maxout (multi-argument) activation functions and when considering the decision boundaries in classification tasks. We also show that the parameter space has a multitude of full-dimensional regions with widely different complexity, and obtain nontrivial lower bounds on the expected complexity. Finally, we investigate different parameter initialization procedures and show that they can increase the speed of convergence in training. ","1"

"11"," We consider the problem of model selection for the general stochastic contextual bandits under the realizability assumption. We propose a successive refinement based algorithm called Adaptive Contextual Bandit ({\ttfamily ACB}), that works in phases and successively eliminates model classes that are too simple to fit the given instance. We prove that this algorithm is adaptive, i.e., the regret rate order-wise matches that of {\ttfamily FALCON}, the state-of-art contextual bandit algorithm of Levi et. al '20, that needs knowledge of the true model class. The price of not knowing the correct model class is only an additive term contributing to the second order term in the regret bound. This cost possess the intuitive property that it becomes smaller as the model class becomes easier to identify, and vice-versa. We then show that a much simpler explore-then-commit (ETC) style algorithm also obtains a regret rate of matching that of {\ttfamily FALCON}, despite not knowing the true model class. However, the cost of model selection is higher in ETC as opposed to in {\ttfamily ACB}, as expected. Furthermore, {\ttfamily ACB} applied to the linear bandit setting with unknown sparsity, order-wise recovers the model selection guarantees previously established by algorithms tailored to the linear setting.

"12","Recent works have revealed that infinitely-wide feed-forward or recurrent neural networks of any architecture correspond to Gaussian processes referred to as NNGP. While these works have extended the class of neural networks converging to Gaussian processes significantly, however, there has been little focus on broadening the class of stochastic processes that such neural networks converge to. In this work, inspired by the scale mixture of Gaussian random variables, we propose the scale mixture of NNGP for which we introduce a prior distribution on the scale of the last-layer parameters. We show that simply introducing a scale prior on the last-layer parameters can turn infinitely-wide neural networks of any architecture into a richer class of stochastic processes. Especially, with certain scale priors, we obtain heavy-tailed stochastic processes, and we recover Student's t processes in the case of inverse gamma priors. We further analyze the distributions of the neural networks initialized with our prior setting and trained with gradient descents and obtain similar results as for NNGP. We present a practical posterior-inference algorithm for the scale mixture of NNGP and empirically demonstrate its usefulness on regression and classification tasks. ","1"

"15","Detecting abrupt changes in temporal behavior patterns is of interest in many industrial and security applications. Abrupt changes are often local and observable primarily through a well-aligned sensing action (e.g., a camera with a narrow field-of-view). Due to resource constraints, continuous monitoring of all of the sensors is impractical. We propose the bandit quickest changepoint detection framework as a means of balancing sensing cost with detection delay. In this framework, sensing actions (or sensors) are sequentially chosen, and only measurements corresponding to chosen actions are observed. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the detection delay for a general class of finitely parameterized probability distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient online sensing scheme, which seamlessly balances the need for exploration of different sensing options with exploitation of querying informative actions. We derive expected delay bounds for the proposed scheme and show that these bounds match our information-theoretic lower bounds at low false alarm rates, establishing optimality of the proposed method. We then perform a number of experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method. ","1"

"17","A solution that is only reliable under favourable conditions is hardly a safe solution. Min Max Optimization is an approach that returns optima that are robust against worst case conditions. We propose algorithms that perform Min Max Optimization in a setting where the function that should be optimized is not known a priori and hence has to be learned by experiments. Therefore we extend the Bayesian Optimization setting, which is tailored to maximization problems, to Min Max Optimization problems. While related work extends the two acquisition functions Expected Improvement and Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound; we extend the two acquisition functions Entropy Search and Knowledge Gradient. These acquisition functions are able to gain knowledge about the optimum instead of just looking for points that are supposed to be optimal. In our evaluation we show that these acquisition functions allow for better solutions - converging faster to the optimum than the benchmark settings. ","1"

"20","In modern deep learning, there is a recent and growing literature on the interplay between large-width asymptotics for deep Gaussian neural networks (NNs), i.e. deep NNs with Gaussian-distributed weights, and classes of Gaussian stochastic processes (SPs). Such an interplay has proved to be critical in several contexts of practical interest, e.g. Bayesian inference under Gaussian SP priors, kernel regression for infinite-wide deep NNs trained via gradient descent, and information propagation within infinite-wide NNs. Motivated by empirical analysis, showing the potential of replacing Gaussian distributions with Stable distributions for the NN's weights, in this paper we investigate large-width asymptotics for (fully connected) feed-forward deep Stable NNs, i.e. deep NNs with Stable-distributed weights. First, we show that as the width goes to infinity jointly over the NN's layers, a suitable rescaled deep Stable NN converges weakly to a Stable SP whose distribution is characterized recursively through the NN's layers. Because of the non-triangular NN's structure, this is a non-standard asymptotic problem, to which we propose a novel and self-contained inductive approach, which may be of independent interest. Then, we establish sup-norm convergence rates of a deep Stable NN to a Stable SP, quantifying the critical difference between the settings of ``joint growth"" and ``sequential growth"" of the width over the NN's layers. Our work extends recent results on infinite-wide limits for deep Gaussian NNs to the more general deep Stable NNs, providing the first result on convergence rates for infinite-wide deep NNs. ","1"
"21","We develop variational Laplace for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) which exploits a local approximation of the curvature of the likelihood to estimate the ELBO without the need for stochastic sampling of the neural-network weights. The Variational Laplace objective is simple to evaluate, as it is (in essence) the log-likelihood, plus weight-decay, plus a squared-gradient regularizer. Variational Laplace gave better test performance and expected calibration errors than maximum a-posteriori inference and standard sampling-based variational inference, despite using the same variational approximate posterior. Finally, we emphasise care needed in benchmarking standard VI as there is a risk of stopping before the variance parameters have converged. We show that early-stopping can be avoided by increasing the learning rate for the variance parameters. ","1"

Although little is known of the subject, she might have been one of his mistresses, and died tragically at a very young age. The painting had been owned by Lea Bondi, a Jewish art dealer who was fleeing the German annexation of Austria and had to sell it in 1939. Restituted to the owners only in 2010, the work now forms part of the collection of the Leopold Museum in Vienna. ","0"
