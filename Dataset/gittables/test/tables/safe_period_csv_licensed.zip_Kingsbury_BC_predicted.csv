Beds and linen were great and spacious rooms. Great value for what you pay at this landmark hotel in Colombo. They go above and beyond to make sure thier guests feel safe and at home when staying here. ","5"
"1","Amazing bed with reasonable toiletries.","5"
"2","My only request was to give me a Harbour side view room but they gave a lousy view room facing the hotel entrance which is disappointing as I think There were not even 20 people in the hotel (very low occupancy), Such poor and inattentive staff they simple ignored my request without even reasoning as I only knew itâs a crappy view when I checked in to room even after I specifically mentioned and they acknowledged !!!The TV wasnât working and had to make more than 4 calls and took more than half an hour to get it fixed. When I was checking out the guy in the reception was asking me what i consumed from mini bar!!! The dam thing was locked with a padlock!!!They call it a 5 star but with definitely 2 star service!","2"
"3","I liked the location of Kingsbury which is in the heart of city of Colombo and the breakfast was awesome with a variety of tasty food, really enjoyed the complementary breakfast.","4"
"4","Since the hotel is of Luxury type, including a tub in the bathroom might have more great.","4"
"5","I really appreciate the service the reception staff and lady who gave a wonderful hand up to my girlfriend birthday surprise , itâs was so outstanding , Thankx a lot for that hope to visit again soon","5"
"6","Room very nice and be bigStuff amazing Food very good","5"

"8","The Kingsbury, Colombo is an Excellent for staying & business meetings.MS OLGA she is an awesome hotelier personality, who received me & family upto Room # 919! I was great to her generous courtesy. Wishing all the best to The Kingsbury Hotel. Regards Mohammad Abul HasnatDhaka, Bangladesh ð§ð©","5"
"9","Mini Bar @ Room was Locked !! It supposed to had complimentary while we had paid US$259/2N while hotel offering $240/2N incl Breakfasts !!","2"
"10","Lovely staff nice room","5"
"11","The restaurant is not up to the standard of the hotelThe view wasnât really a sea view as there is alot of construction works ruining the view","4"
"12","I have stayed at this hotel recently! I have had another comfortable stay! The servic was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful!","5"
"13","Nothing of any great importance!","4"
"14","Good location....Great breakfast 
","5"
"15","Hotel staffs are rude, none of them have smiles on the face, no welcoming at all , no respect to the guests. The management should inquiry about this unhappiness of staffs","1"
"16","The staff and facilities were excellent. The whole experience was elegant and very professional. You can clearly see that you do get what you pay for. Even when there were questions, the manager was very professional and we were able to sit down together and discuss any issue which was cleared up and resolved in a pleasant manner. Food was amazing as well. All hotel staff are very courteous and well mannered. It did not disappoint.Will continue to recommend.","5"
"17","Position, services and facilities all the top. Very nice the roof terrace which offers a great selection of cocktails and quick tasty and quality food","5"
"18","A cockroach crawled in the bedroom in the morning, though the room was perfectly clean and neat. It might have been a random happening and didn't cause us any problem.","3"
"19","-Spacious and confortable big room

"20","The location of Kingsbury Hotel is wonderful, just a few steps from Clomobo Fort, very close to the Bank of Ceylon Tower.","5"
"21","The interior decoration is a bit out of fashion, needs some improvement work to meet up with counterparts.","4"
"22","The Hotel is absolutely amazing, the breakfast is just stunning. You can use outside swimming pool with is really nice. Was nice to spend our last night in Sri Lanka in this hotel. The personal, very friendly always willing to help.","5"
"23","We was not lucky with the view from the room. But it's nothing to complain.","5"
"24","Details at the room as fruit baskets, chocolates, flowers and wine! Very friendly and helpful staff! All the restaurants had delicious food and the whole atmosphere was perfect!","5"
"25","There's nothing I can complaint of. Everything was extremely perfect!","5"
"26","On plus side Hoel is great and never encountered on member of staff who was not polite and they could not make you more welcome.
Roof bar is great for cocktail and food and views at night are great.
All this far out ways the no view from rooms.
Would stay here again when visiting Colombo in future
A great stay
Thanks","4"
"27","Only downfall was no views from rooms","4"
"28","The very active local (I presume wedding) receptions on the ground floor meant you always met people with beautiful saree dresses. The pool was pleasant, the room was very comfortable, we picked the hotel based on it's location - we walked locally.","5"
"29","Not enough sockets and they were not universal.","4"
"30","The buffet in the harbour restaurant was the best I've ever experienced, allowing you to really sample a bit of everything and experience some authentic,  non tourist, cuisine. The restaurant was packed with Sri Lankan people, which is always a good sign. It cost about Â£15 per person and was worth every penny. Spotlessly clean and you can watch the chefs preparing the food. ","5"
"31","The building site outside the windows- the ocean is now nearly totally obscured by the land reclamation. Perhaps from a top floor you might be able to see the water. ","5"
"32","Smiling, helpful staff. Good ambience, amenities.","5"
"33","We found little choice in vegetarian food item spread.  Veg and  non veg counters should be kept separately.","5"
"34","Old world charm with modern comfort. Luxury and super charm! ","5"
"35","Breakfast staff struggled - gave me dirty cutlery and tea cup from another table. The tables around us were dirty and piled with dirty plates for the entire breakfast - no one bothered to clean them. Asked for tea but waiter literally ignored me.
Spa was poorly stocked and no bathrobe provided.
","3"
"36","Location ","4"
"37","Some of the staff looks racist,particularly who make omelet , on 17 th morning 8.30 am standing in front of him for 10 minutes but the fate guy who make omelet not even bothered to look at me . He greeting every white male & women passing by. So it's very annoying..","3"
"38","We chose this hotel because itâs very close to Ministry of crab restaurant (which was amazing) and the price seemed good for 5*. 
Decent room with rollout bed for my daughter. Usual things youâd expect from this type of hotel. Mini bar, robes etc. 
Really comfy pillows. 
Amazing shower and water pressure. We wanted to stay in there forever! 
Breakfast was nice with a huge selection.
Check in/out fast and efficient. ","4"
"39","Nice smelling toiletries except full of palm oil which I hate. Donât care how fancy they are if rain forest is destroyed to produce them. 
Swimming pool was too cold. 
Staff at pool a bit clueless. One lady was brought a sheesha by the staff and she sat blowing it in our faces while we ate! She was at the foot of our lounger as she wanted shade. Only when junior manager came did she leave. 
Food and drinks by the pool awful. No idea how to make basic cocktails at all and below average food. 
","4"
"40","I liked the rooms at kingsbury, very cozy and clean. ","4"
"41","The pool area is surrounded by seating for the pool restaurant, mostly occupied by people from outside the hotel. I felt there was no privacy at all while using the pool, which was very uncomfortable. ","3"
"42","The facilities were satisfied compared to the the money we have paid.Music, food and decor very nice. The bathroom and the amenities in our room were great compared to other hotels we be been in Sri Lanka.The concierge service was very good & helpful.The duty manager was very also helpful when we addressed him our problems in our stay.","4"
"43","The view was terrible, construction site (without having a notice).The room service was very slow and needed reminding about orders.The room way too noisy.In the room (211) the cupboard was build in a way that were blocking the draws and we could not open/use them at all.In general the room we ve stayed needs refurbishment.","2"
"44","We loved everything about the room, from the colors, the decor, to the bathroom. Everything was perfect and smelled nice and clean. Our room also had a nice view of Galle Face beach, and our 8-year-old son was also able to request a nice hug pillow. Room service was great.","5"
"45","nothing! everything was perfect.","5"
"46","Staff friendliness, beautifull design, food excellent quality.","5"
"47","At the check out the payment and the bill was a littÃ©e problematic. The  receptionist has started 4 times when finally the right invoice was printed. It took 45 min!!!!","3"
"48","A great location in central Colombo, with a good buffet breakfast. We used the spa, which was great. The room was comfortable and overall the stay matched our expectations and the relatively expensive price tag.","4"
"49","the buffet is very big with good dessert choices. the ambience at the rooftop bar was lovely and the cocktails they had were very good. overall a lovely stay.","4"
"50","we had in room breakfast every morning and would order the same dishes and found inconsistencies in the food. the hotel is a bit run down at the moment. hallway walls to the rooms need painting and etc. also the hotel. has weddings and other parties everyday so its an in demand hotel.","4"
"51","Great breakfast. The service at the pool bar. ","5"
"52","The view from the pool. The hotel asked 11700 lkr (65  Usd) for an Airport transfer. We orderd a car through the ""pick me"" app for 2500 lkr. Don't use their transport/Travel desk, it's totally overpriced.","3"
"53","Good location ","3"
"54","Been coming here for awhile itâs really gone down hill over the last few years, the service is poor and the rooms are dated with many faults  ","2"
"55","Good location, excellent facilities and high standard of service especially in renovated floors and superior executive rooms.
Great staff. Comfortable and clean rooms, nice pool and dining options.
Not my first stay at Kingsbury. Will stay here again as it is a great property with excellent staff and service!","5"
"56","Like most SL hotels, peak period room rates are higher than comparable rates in other SE Asian destinations.
Restaurant prices a bit on the high side.
Minor comment - Noticed a few small cockroaches around the place, even in the spa room! Can be a common problem in tropical climates and not restricted to this hotel. Perhaps regular pest control will fix this.","4"
"57","I loved the room after a complaint. Thank you so much that I ended up extending for one more night. Instead of check out on the spot.","4"
"58","Was after a jet lug didn't get a room i requested for. Until I asked for a check out. And upgraded to 8th floor. From 2nd floor.","4"
"59","All of the staff were very welcoming and there was a wide selection of food. Nice view and comfy beds and pillows. Room service was very good.","4"
"60","The rooms were a little small and cramped.","4"
"61","I've booked this room for my parents and brother and we stayed 10 days in room number 413 from the 5th-15th December.Excellent service, I must mention the names of Mr Sandaruwan Ratnayake from reception team and Kenneth Balasooriya from the house keeping team were extreamly helpful. My little son was sick and we had a tough time during our stay needing extra care in cleaning. Kenneth Balasooriya has done a marvellous job, simply perfect job. Hats off to both of them , they are treating everyone with love and care and goes that extra mile.Hats off to all the team members of Kingsbury hotel. We loved our stay. Only negative point- Accounts department needs a little improvement as they are mostly confused with transactions...other than that just superb. Happy New Year to Kingsbury team","5"
"62","Accounts department, they were confused , making simple things complicated.","3"
"63","Bvalgari products in the bathroom, room overlooking the ocean, location right at the focal point of Colombo, more than a 100 breakfast items, double this amount in dinner, what else can one ask for? It was our 10th anniversary and the staff surprised us with a bouquet, a greeting card and a delicious chocolate walnut cake.If youâre headed to Colombo, THIS is the only place where you should stay and eat.","4"
"64","Receiption by Ms. Olega is highly appreciated. Shes was very kind and she helped us by giving information about Colombo and places to visit. We really thank Ms. Olega.","4"
"65","Check in and check out took long time","4"
"66","The hotel started off really well. Check in was great, room seemed nice and the facilities were good.","4"
"67","It's one of the busiest hotels I've been too, 5 weddings happening in one evening so it was hard just to move around. The pool is part of Honey Bar which is now overlooking a mass building site...No chance of sea views. Our room was also overlooking the same honey bar which doesn't stop playing music until gone midnight. We asked for a room change and after a long while they gave it to us! Basically even though the staff are nice, the room is fine, it's massively overpriced and way too loud. Not a chill place to be and won't go back!","3"
"68","Service around the pool was perfect and the service staff were very friendly and helpful. Whether early in the morning or during the day, They always had an eye for me. In addition, the entry with the receptionist - I think her name was Olga - was very professional.","5"
"69","SERVICE in the cafe area.","5"
"70","The bed was comfortable and the hotel in a good location. Food at the hotel was amazing, especially at the buffet. ","4"
"71","There was a lot of staff who were polite but none were very helpful. Multiple mistakes were made, including double charging of credit cards (which are still to be rectified over week later). The rooms are dated, with small showers and bathrooms. Our room was non-smoking but still smelt of cigarette smoke. I expected more from a five star hotel, it wasnât worth the money. ","2"
"72","The room was lovely and staff attentive.","5"
"73","We were a little disappointed by the dining options, not really to our taste- there was a large Buffett menu or basic pub food, as well as some others we went to The Grill- the staff were brilliant but we felt the food a little below the standard we expected. Also the breakfast food wasn't that nice- but suppose this is part of being such a big hotel.","4"
"74","Very good breakfast with fantastic dining areas. Nice bars and very pleasant staff. Nice location with easy access to bars and restaurants.","5"
"75","Clean towels always arrive much later than when the guest room is cleaned. seems like they have to wash the towels on the day!","3"
"76","love the pancake sauces.. everything amazing.. very happy with the anniversary cake, card, roses and suite upgrade","5"
"77","TV in suite is facing the window.. not facing a sofa nor facing the bed","5"
"78","Excellent location and very good rooms. Exceptional cleanliness. The breakfast buffet spread is huge! and very good quality food.","4"
"79","There was a lot of confusion among the staff during our check out, regarding bill settlement. We had changed our room category, and we had settled the bill the night prior. Just while we were leaving for the airport at 4.30am, we were told that there was an error in bill calculation and that we had to pay more! After a lot of fuss and time being wasted, we settled the same and left, to thankfully make it on time for the flight. The staff dont seem to be updating each other of important details like this!","3"
"80","I was upgraded to a Club room and after going to my room i did go to the lounge and when eating something to my rude shock the person tells me that it is only a room only upgrade and I cant eat there. I was never told that in the reception and also if it was an upgrade the what is the hotel going to lose if i were to eat a few snacks. I really consider to take this up with the manager during my ext trip and do hope the staff are taught how to handle guests. This is my second bad experience at this hotel","2"
"81","Friendly staff, nice room, good food in the restaurant. ","5"
"82","Very noisy :/ 
Sound from pool area and hallway was very noticeable during the whole stay, day and night. Sleep was not good because of that ","3"
"83","We loved the accommodations so much after our first night in Sri Lanka that we ended up deciding to book another stay when we were to end up back in Colombo. It was a great hotel for the value, and definitely exceeded our expectations. It ended up becoming a highlight for us after a couple of weeks of backpacking to end up back at THE KINGSBURY!","5"
"84","Somethings were expensive, but it was to be expected.","3"
"85","The hotel charged me for one extra night. I checked in early on 6th and checked out on 9th - being 3 days whereas the booking was for 4 days. At the time they mentioned everything was ok but later recovered 1 additional night stating that the booking was for 4 nights","4"
"86","Had the best buffet I have ever experienced. Both for breakfast and dinner.","4"
"87","We booked and Ocean view for extra dollars and that is all it was, a very small ocean view. Not what is shown on the web site.","2"
"88","Only cleanliness","5"
"89","Very small rooms, pathetic breakfast buffet, hotel overpriced according to location and amenities, not even served any welcome drink, staff not courteous....(: (:","2"
"90","Lovely rooms and very comfortable beds. Range of food choices.","4"
"91","Pool looks over a main road and building site with the ongoing harbour developments which is a shame.","3"
"92","The bed was the best ever ....good poolside food and bar , not expensive and great location..","5"
"93","Slow and insufficient lifts ... some staff couldnât speak English... we didnât enjoy the breakfast ","1"
"94","Friendly welcome, beautiful hotel and a bed so comfortable, it would be fit for a king","5"
"95","View of building work next to the hotel (we did not lower our rating of the hotel as itâs out of their control)","3"
"96","The welcome and checkin was friendly and welcoming. We were shown to the room with our luggage following close behind. We only stayed two nights eating in the buffet restaurant once which was ok but Iâm not a fan of buffet meals. Breakfast was very good with a wide range of food. The pool is great and sun loungers comfy. We had a really nice lunch at the pool. The Ibiza type music around the pool got a little loud but was great later in the afternoon. The hotel arranged some train tickets for us which were ready for collection upon arrival. The one downside was the price of the taxis associated to the hotel I would recommend them not to be used, it was raining some we needed one to a restaurant less than 5 mins away and was charged Â£15 the same to the station. However, the Kingsbury was exceptional and I would 100% recommend it.","4"
"97","The in-house transport.","4"
"98","Hotel is really well located to the Dutch Hospital precinct. We were upgraded on an early arrival which we really appreciated. The room was spacious but the ocean view was a Little distant as what once was beach has been reclaimed and is now a building site. The bar had a fantastic jazz singer, Charmaine Jones, singing the night we were there which was a real treat.","4"
"99","The pool area has a restaurant and played loud âdoor doofâ music from late afternoon until the early hours. While we didnât directly overlook the pool we could still hear it from our end room. The hotel needs to decide whether itâs a night club or a high end hotel.","4"
"100","That the staff is highly cooperative and keeps always alert over one's needs, giving or anticipating great solutions.","5"
