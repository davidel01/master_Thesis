"About This Dashboard","The Europeana Statistics Dashboard has been developed to act as a space where partners, researchers, stakeholders and anyone interested in Europeana can interact and re-use the statistics coming out of our websites and services. Europeana is a network, representing more than 2,500 cultural heritage organisations and a thousand individuals from these and other walks of life, passionate about bringing Europe’s vast wealth of cultural heritage to the world. 

Traditionally our statistics and metrics have been locked up in formatted documents, now we are liberating that data, visualising it and making it embeddable and re-useable. With this dashboard it is now much easier to see how Europeana has progressed and evolved through the years and how we are working to increase the reach of our data providers’ collections. Many of the visualisations are dynamic and utilise both the Europeana and Google Analytics APIs to generate charts that are accurate and up to date. 

Some of the key metrics that we are visualising in this dashboard include traffic and usage figures for the Europeana.eu website, social media reach, the size and composition of the Europeana repository, together with the number of digital object views on Europeana for a selection of our data providers. 

An alpha version of the Statistics Dashboard was released in October 2014 and a beta version is due to be realised in 2015. During this alpha phase we are eager to hear your feedback, also if you are a data provider and would like to have statistics related to your collection available via this dashboard please [**contact us**][1].

"Content: 2014","This section of the dashboard visualises various aspects of the digital objects available in the Europeana repository during 2014. Charts display the re-use status of the digital objects, the types of digital objects available, together with a breakdown from which countries the digital objects originate. All visualisations are broken down by quarter to see how Europeana has grown and evolved over time. Every month the Europeana aggregation team publishes new collections and updates to the Europeana repository from hundreds of institutions. 

This entire article along with all individual charts is embeddable. Also the data from each visualisation is downloadable in CSV format. We encourage you to use these charts and data in your own research and reporting. If you would like more detailed statistics, please [**contact us**][1] and we will be more than happy to provide you with more information.

"Welcome","<H4>Please note that this dashboard is currently in an alpha phase of development, therefore you may encounter a number of issues when testing this service. During this alpha phase we are eager to hear [your feedback][1].</H4>

Welcome to the Europeana Statistics Dashboard; a dynamic space where we crunch and visualise the key metrics coming out of [**Europeana**][2]. We invite you to explore, interact and re-use the visualisations in this dashboard which are ordered into the following three categories; Content, Traffic & Usage, and Data Providers. The [**Content**][3] section visualises statistics related to the number of digital objects available in the Europeana repository. The [**Traffic & Usage**][4] section visualises statistics related to web traffic on the Europeana.eu website together with statistics related to Europeana’s reach on social media and Wikipedia. And finally the [**Data Providers**][5] section visualises statistics related to traffic and usage on the Europeana.eu website for a number of data providers.

<H3>Increasing the Reach of Cultural Collections</H3>
This chart displays the number of pageviews on Europeana's end-user websites (E*uropeana.eu, Exhibitions, Blog, Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989*) together with the number of impressions generated on social media and Wikipedia since 2011. 
Impressions on social media where generated using data providers' collections on Facebook and Pinterest via Europeana.eu, Europeana 1989 and Europeana 1914-1918 profiles. While impressions on Wikipedia are based on the total number of views of Wikipedia articles that include images uploaded to Wikimedia Commons that are directly related to Europeana, or related to Europeana’s outreach activities with the Wiki community. Explore more statistics related to social media and Wikipedia in [**Traffic & Usage**][6] section of this dashboard.

 "
"About","Welcome to the Europeana Statistics Dashboard.
  ----------------------------------------

  Europeana helps cultural institutions across Europe to share their digital collections with a wider audience. We collect data from thousands of institutions from all European countries.

  The Europeana Statistics Dashboard provides all our data partners with information about how audiences use the material available through Europeana Collections. This insight into how collections are used is essential for cultural heritage institutions and helps them to make the most of their collaboration with Europeana.

  As well as information about the entirety of Europeana Collections, each institution, aggregator and country can see how many times their collections have been viewed, what the most popular items are, what  copyright statuses are being used and much more. Use the top navigation to browse or to find your own personal dashboard.
"
"Help","**Q. What does the Statistics Dashboard show?**

Each Dashboard shows a range of information that we think every data partner will be interested in. For example, you can find out how many items are in each collection, how many views they’re receiving and where in the world your top audiences are. There’s also information about your best performing items and the copyright statuses of your collection items.

**Q. How do you get the traffic data for my specific institution/aggregator/country?**

We use a combination of the Europeana API and Google Analytics API.

In Europeana,the dataset number is always present in the url of a record - Google Analytics counts how many times this specific url is viewed.

For institution or country statistics, the Dashboard queries a specific data partner or country name in the Europeana API and looks for all associated dataset numbers. These are then combined in a filter and put through Google Analytics.

**Q. Can I look at statistics before 2013?**

No. At the end of 2012 Europeana started tracking the traffic using Google Analytics

**Q. Why can’t I can’t find my dashboard?**

A: The most common explanation is that your collection is part of one dataset to which  multiple institutions contributed. We can only extract statistics for whole datasets - we can’t filter out material from one institution if it’s part of a bigger set. Please get in touch if you want to provide a new dataset containing only your collection.

**Q I don’t want my dashboard to be public**

If you are uncomfortable with the statistics data of your institution being public we can remove the dashboard for you.

**Q. Why are there multiple dashboards for my institution?**

This is because your institution has contributed to  Europeana multiple times under different names. Some institutions take different routes into Europeana and provide different datasets each time. If the name of the institution is not used consistently , then multiple identifiers are created. A common example is when an institution adds an article to their name e.g. contributing as  ‘The national library of ABC’ and ‘National library of ABC’ on different occasions. Please get in touch if you want to solve this issue.

**Q. Are you going to further develop the dashboard?**

Yes. On the 6th of April 2016, we launched the first public beta version of the dashboard. We are now collecting feedback for the second version. We will look into improving the data and charts, and adding new charts. You can provide your own feedback by getting in touch.

**Q. My question is not answered**

Then please get in touch. We expect quite some traffic in the first phase of the dashboard so please allow a couple of days before we get back to you.
