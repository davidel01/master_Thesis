"good afternoon","00:00:05.390","00:00:08.110"
"so today we'll cover section ","00:00:08.110","00:00:09.390"
"5.2, definitive integral ","00:00:09.390","00:00:16.390"
"so we'll start from a very important definition ","00:00:21.710","00:00:24.420"
"we'll define the definitive integral","00:00:24.420","00:00:27.940"
"let's assume that we have a function F","00:00:27.940","00:00:31.689"
"defined on an interval ","00:00:31.689","00:00:35.420"
"AB, okay, then we'll take ","00:00:35.420","00:00:40.489"
"this interval and form a partition ","00:00:40.489","00:00:45.300"
"that is with sin points x_1, x_2","00:00:53.070","00:00:57.370"
"x_3 and so on ","00:00:57.370","00:01:01.059"
"x now coincides with A and x ","00:01:01.059","00:01:04.570"
"n coincides with b, okay ","00:01:04.570","00:01:08.600"
"then so make a partition x_0, x_1, ","00:01:08.600","00:01:12.190"
"x_n, then we'll pick ","00:01:12.190","00:01:17.049"
"sample points. Pick sampling points ","00:01:17.049","00:01:20.799"
"which we'll call x_1*, x_2*,  ","00:01:27.770","00:01:31.799"
"x_n*. Basically ","00:01:31.799","00:01:35.530"
"inside each sub-interval ","00:01:35.530","00:01:38.579"
"the cycle x_1*, x_2*","00:01:38.579","00:01:43.200"
"and so on. remember these points ","00:01:43.200","00:01:46.479"
"they could be either the leftmost point of this subinterval, the rightmost point of this subinterval ","00:01:46.479","00:01:50.960"
"or somewhere in between. Okay, ","00:01:51.780","00:01:54.939"
"then we say that ","00:01:54.939","00:02:01.420"
"define ","00:02:01.420","00:02:01.920"
"an integral ","00:02:01.920","00:02:05.869"
"from a to b ","00:02:05.869","00:02:09.970"
"f(x) dx to be equal to ","00:02:09.970","00:02:14.310"
"the limit as n goes to infinity ","00:02:14.310","00:02:18.370"
"of the following sum. It goes from 1 to n ","00:02:18.370","00:02:22.450"
"f(x_1)* ","00:02:22.450","00:02:25.700"
"delta x. So here delta x ","00:02:25.700","00:02:30.230"
"normally if they're equal length it's b-a ","00:02:30.230","00:02:34.190"
"over n. That's the length of individual intervals. ","00:02:34.190","00:02:37.420"
"okay, so this ","00:02:37.420","00:02:40.470"
"definition is valid if","00:02:40.470","00:02:43.610"
"the limit exists","00:02:43.610","00:02:48.549"
"and is","00:02:48.549","00:02:51.959"
"the same for all","00:02:51.959","00:02:57.420"
"choices ","00:02:57.420","00:03:00.530"
"of sampling points. So for instance it could happen ","00:03:00.530","00:03:07.530"
"if I choose the sampling points to be ","00:03:09.349","00:03:12.819"
"the left side of each interval, the left hand rule, and I take the limit, I get a ","00:03:12.819","00:03:16.189"
"number","00:03:16.189","00:03:16.709"
"then I choose them to be the right side of each interval ","00:03:16.709","00:03:20.060"
"and if the limit is different, then this definition doesn't make sense ","00:03:20.060","00:03:23.629"
"so it only makes sense if the limit exists, and if it's the same for any ","00:03:23.629","00:03:27.019"
"choice","00:03:27.019","00:03:27.599"
"of all of the sampling points ","00:03:27.599","00:03:31.480"
"so I'm going to start by making an introduction ","00:03:31.480","00:03:34.970"
"so let's look at this new symbol and","00:03:34.970","00:03:38.599"
"talk about its components. First of all, ","00:03:38.599","00:03:42.379"
"this guy here is the integral sign ","00:03:42.379","00:03:46.650"
" ","00:03:46.650","00:03:49.909"
"and it looks like an elongated s ","00:03:49.909","00:03:54.540"
"why s? Because it's equal to a sum ","00:03:54.540","00:03:58.260"
"so it's the limit of a sum. So the symbol s comes from that word. ","00:03:58.260","00:04:02.370"
"and and b ","00:04:02.370","00:04:05.590"
"are the limits of integration ","00:04:05.590","00:04:12.189"
"limits of integration ","00:04:12.189","00:04:17.780"
"this heref","00:04:17.780","00:04:21.450"
"is called the integrand ","00:04:21.450","00:04:24.580"
"and finally ","00:04:24.580","00:04:30.710"
"this differential here ","00:04:30.710","00:04:37.710"
"tells me what is my independent variable","00:04:37.890","00:04:42.190"
"okay my horizontal axis ","00:04:42.190","00:04:45.820"
"is called X in this case and this","00:04:45.820","00:04:49.260"
"variable has to match, you know, the variable ","00:04:49.260","00:04:52.880"
"upon which the function f depends. ","00:04:52.880","00:04:56.800"
"We'll call this variable the silent variable of integration ","00:04:56.800","00:05:00.090"
"so let me show you. So ","00:05:00.090","00:05:03.420"
"the limit from a to b ","00:05:03.420","00:05:06.860"
"f(x)dx","00:05:06.860","00:05:09.930"
"actually can be written as the integral
of ","00:05:09.930","00:05:13.760"
"f(y)dy. Or I could insert any lette r","00:05:13.760","00:05:18.550"
"and the answer won't change. Why is that? ","00:05:18.550","00:05:23.320"
"well if you look look at the right hand
side of this definition","00:05:23.320","00:05:28.500"
"okay and if you take","00:05:28.500","00:05:31.960"
"f to be x^2","00:05:31.960","00:05:35.710"
"remember, we actually did this exercise last time ","00:05:35.710","00:05:38.990"
"we said let's consider ","00:05:38.990","00:05:42.200"
"the parabola f=x^2","00:05:42.200","00:05:45.970"
"and we actually calculated this sum. What was it equal to? ","00:05:45.970","00:05:50.220"
"1/3, right? So we got a number. Does this number depend on x? ","00:05:50.220","00:05:55.000"
"no, it's a number. It's not a function. So whatever you get as an answer here ","00:05:55.000","00:05:59.300"
"does not depend on x ","00:05:59.300","00:06:01.100"
"so x cannot appear in the final answer. So you can replace it by anything else ","00:06:01.100","00:06:04.830"
"the answer won't change. So we'll call it a silent ","00:06:04.830","00:06:09.240"
"variable","00:06:09.240","00:06:12.560"
"of integration ","00:06:12.560","00:06:17.340"
"so x or y or anything else ","00:06:17.340","00:06:21.110"
"questions? ","00:06:21.110","00:06:25.310"
"question? student: Yeah, I'm a little bit confused ","00:06:25.310","00:06:28.390"
"most of the time we plug in x as the independent variable and ","00:06:28.390","00:06:31.430"
"not y, so in the case of the right hand side ","00:06:31.430","00:06:35.710"
"are we plugging in a y value of a and a y value of b? Instructor: y is just a variable. ","00:06:35.710","00:06:40.470"
"I can call it alpha. I can call it... ","00:06:40.470","00:06:44.350"
"t. Absolutely, yeah. So you're right, usually the convention is that usually ","00:06:44.350","00:06:49.620"
"when you draw a graph, this is y, this is x ","00:06:49.620","00:06:53.160"
"so not to get confused, we don't often use y there ","00:06:53.160","00:06:56.910"
"but we might. We can. ","00:06:56.910","00:07:00.350"
"Okay. So finally ","00:07:00.350","00:07:03.390"
"this guy here also has a name ","00:07:03.390","00:07:06.460"
"this is called the Reinmann sum ","00:07:06.460","00:07:13.460"
"and we'll practice to evaluate such sums ","00:07:14.820","00:07:18.500"
"today. Okay? ","00:07:18.500","00:07:21.580"
"so what is the meaning of this new object? ","00:07:21.580","00:07:26.170"
"let me do it here ","00:07:26.170","00:07:29.550"
"so if","00:07:29.550","00:07:33.680"
"the function of x is non-negative ","00:07:33.680","00:07:38.370"
"on the interval [ab]","00:07:38.370","00:07:42.780"
"then the integral of ","00:07:42.780","00:07:47.080"
"f(x)dx what is the meaning of that? ","00:07:47.080","00:07:50.760"
"do you remember? Exactly ","00:07:50.760","00:07:54.310"
"because we already saw this right hand side. We only did it for non-negative ","00:07:54.310","00:07:58.630"
"functions","00:07:58.630","00:07:59.600"
"and we said, ""that's the area.""  Remember, we split it ","00:07:59.600","00:08:02.610"
"into a number of vertical ","00:08:02.610","00:08:05.720"
"rectangles. We calculated the area . So this is ","00:08:05.720","00:08:10.210"
"the area under ","00:08:10.210","00:08:14.270"
"the curve f","00:08:14.270","00:08:17.650"
"f(x) between ","00:08:17.650","00:08:20.940"
"a and b. So it has a very clear meaning","00:08:20.960","00:08:25.470"
"for non negative f","00:08:25.470","00:08:28.480"
"okay now what happens if f","00:08:28.480","00:08:32.390"
"changes sign so for instance we can
consider","00:08:32.390","00:08:37.630"
"this kind of function ","00:08:37.630","00:08:41.459"
"see this takes both positive and
negative values","00:08:41.459","00:08:45.290"
"so if you look at the definition you can
see we can do the Reinmann sum ","00:08:45.290","00:08:50.330"
"we can do these, so first we have these rectangles ","00:08:50.330","00:08:54.009"
"and we have these rectangles, okay, ","00:08:54.009","00:08:57.060"
"and if you look at the formula they all
have the same base","00:08:57.060","00:09:01.550"
"they all have different height, and the height of these is actually negative ","00:09:01.550","00:09:05.610"
"so we can do these separately. We can group these together, and we get the area ","00:09:05.610","00:09:09.149"
"area under this","00:09:09.149","00:09:10.120"
"part of the curve, and then this here ","00:09:10.120","00:09:13.860"
"gives me also an area, but it has a negative sign because ","00:09:13.860","00:09:17.279"
"each of the the components here has a
negative","00:09:17.279","00:09:20.790"
"height. So if we call this area ","00:09:20.790","00:09:24.660"
"A1 and this area A2","00:09:24.660","00:09:28.370"
"then the integral of ","00:09:28.370","00:09:31.569"
"f(x)dx is equal to A1 minus ","00:09:31.569","00:09:35.279"
"A2. This is called the net area ","00:09:35.279","00:09:39.459"
"or the signed area","00:09:39.459","00:09:43.089"
"net area","00:09:43.089","00:09:46.389"
"or signed","00:09:46.389","00:09:50.480"
"area","00:09:50.480","00:09:57.480"
"so normally we will assume that the function f","00:09:59.900","00:10:03.130"
"that appears under the integral is either continuous","00:10:03.130","00:10:07.020"
"or it has a finite number of
discontinuities","00:10:07.020","00:10:10.470"
"okay ","00:10:10.470","00:10:13.470"
"and next I'm going to show you an example ","00:10:13.470","00:10:16.470"
" of using this definition to calculate","00:10:16.470","00:10:20.100"
"the integral. And this example ","00:10:20.100","00:10:24.930"
"is such that we will know the answer ","00:10:24.930","00:10:29.190"
"before we did any calculations","00:10:29.190","00:10:32.330"
"so in this example ","00:10:32.330","00:10:35.520"
"we said ","00:10:35.520","00:10:38.820"
"that f(x) is x-3","00:10:38.820","00:10:42.770"
"we'll say that ","00:10:42.770","00:10:46.460"
"x belongs on the interval from 1 to 4","00:10:46.460","00:10:50.870"
" ","00:10:50.870","00:10:54.200"
"evaluate ","00:10:54.200","00:10:58.750"
"f(x) ","00:10:58.750","00:11:01.980"
"dx by using ","00:11:01.980","00:11:07.800"
"the definition. Before I use the definition I'm going to give you an answer ","00:11:07.800","00:11:14.450"
"so this function","00:11:14.450","00:11:19.970"
"is a straight line","00:11:19.970","00:11:23.570"
"and ","00:11:23.570","00:11:26.570"
"this is what allows me to give you an
answer","00:11:26.570","00:11:30.750"
"or you are going to give me an answer, okay? ","00:11:30.750","00:11:34.800"
"so let's plot f(x) which is ","00:11:34.800","00:11:38.680"
"x-3 as a function of x. At 0,","00:11:38.680","00:11:42.520"
"we'll get -3. It crosses the horizontal axis ","00:11:42.520","00:11:46.820"
"at 3, okay, ","00:11:46.820","00:11:53.820"
"its value at 4 is equal to 1, it's value at ","00:11:55.890","00:12:00.940"
"1 is given at 2 ","00:12:00.940","00:12:04.150"
"so","00:12:04.160","00:12:09.910"
"we're interested in ","00:12:09.910","00:12:14.150"
"the integral of this function","00:12:14.150","00:12:17.880"
"between 1 and 4. Okay? ","00:12:17.880","00:12:21.820"
"so we talked about that, it actually does change sign, ","00:12:21.820","00:12:25.070"
"so to calculate it simply, ","00:12:25.070","00:12:28.600"
"we can calculate this area and you can
calculate this area ","00:12:28.600","00:12:35.579"
"and remember that this area comes with a
negative sign, right? ","00:12:35.579","00:12:38.650"
"so let's call this A1","00:12:38.650","00:12:41.920"
"the positive area, let's call this A2","00:12:41.920","00:12:45.070"
"and let's calculate them from geometric considerations. This is easier ","00:12:45.070","00:12:49.339"
"what's the area of this object? It's a triangle ","00:12:49.339","00:12:53.290"
"1/2. It has a base of 1, a height of 1 ","00:12:53.290","00:12:57.370"
"so it's 1x1 over 2","00:12:57.370","00:13:00.430"
"is 1/2. This one- what's the area of this? ","00:13:00.430","00:13:04.780"
"so","00:13:04.780","00:13:08.160"
"2. so this is 2","00:13:08.160","00:13:11.700"
"times 2 over 2 ","00:13:11.700","00:13:15.670"
"is 2. So what's the answer? ","00:13:15.670","00:13:19.360"
"we have A1 minus","00:13:19.360","00:13:23.050"
"A2 is 1/2 minus 2","00:13:23.050","00:13:27.690"
"is -3/2. So whatever ","00:13:27.690","00:13:31.420"
"magic we're doing here, we're expecting to
get this answer","00:13:31.420","00:13:35.089"
"so let's keep that in mind ","00:13:35.089","00:13:39.339"
"and perform the calculations. We're going to use this definition","00:13:39.339","00:13:46.339"
" in order to use the definitions","00:13:47.060","00:13:54.060"
"I have to know delta x, ","00:13:55.860","00:13:58.959"
"x_i*, and f of that amount. So let's do it step by step ","00:13:58.959","00:14:02.900"
"the easiest one is delta x ","00:14:02.900","00:14:07.610"
"we have to go b","00:14:07.610","00:14:10.920"
"minus A over n, so it's 4","00:14:10.920","00:14:14.300"
"minus 1 over n is 3","00:14:14.300","00:14:17.339"
"over n. Questions? ","00:14:17.339","00:14:21.949"
"now we have to create a partition so","00:14:21.949","00:14:27.640"
"A is 1, B ","00:14:27.640","00:14:31.890"
"is 4. What is","00:14:31.890","00:14:36.120"
"x1? so I'm going to have x1, x2","00:14:36.120","00:14:40.150"
"x3 and so on ","00:14:40.150","00:14:43.170"
"so each of these intervals have length 3/n","00:14:43.170","00:14:48.000"
"3/n","00:14:48.000","00:14:51.690"
"3/n. So what is the value","00:14:51.690","00:14:56.530"
"of x1? ","00:14:56.530","00:15:01.630"
"it's to the right of 1, the distance is 3/n, so it's one ","00:15:01.630","00:15:06.329"
"plus 3/n, right?","00:15:06.329","00:15:10.089"
"now what's the value of x2? ","00:15:10.089","00:15:14.050"
"it's one plus twice that thing, so ","00:15:14.050","00:15:17.160"
"2*(3/n)","00:15:17.160","00:15:20.770"
"this guy is 1 + ","00:15:20.770","00:15:24.430"
"3 times 3/n","00:15:24.430","00:15:30.380"
"So we can see the pattern. The pattern is that x_i","00:15:30.380","00:15:34.990"
"equals 1+ so for each i ","00:15:34.990","00:15:38.300"
"I have to step i times. So I have i","00:15:38.339","00:15:42.480"
"times delta x, 3","00:15:42.480","00:15:45.850"
"over n. Questions? ","00:15:45.850","00:15:52.850"
"so these are the values of x1 x2 x3","00:15:52.959","00:15:56.510"
"these are not quite what I need, I need sampling points ","00:15:56.510","00:15:59.560"
"and this is really my choice. I am going to use the right hand rule ","00:15:59.560","00:16:05.030"
"use the right","00:16:05.030","00:16:09.550"
"hand rule. What does it mean? ","00:16:09.550","00:16:13.480"
"that if I have  an interval xi-1","00:16:13.480","00:16:17.449"
"xi, I'm going to take my sampling point","00:16:17.449","00:16:20.560"
"to coincide with the rightmost border of that interval ","00:16:20.560","00:16:24.790"
"so xi*","00:16:24.790","00:16:28.060"
"is going to be equal to xi which is 1 plus ","00:16:28.060","00:16:31.329"
"plus i3/n","00:16:31.329","00:16:36.180"
"the last step before I can write down the definition is to evaluate the ","00:16:36.180","00:16:39.930"
"function","00:16:39.930","00:16:40.620"
"at this point f(xi*)","00:16:40.620","00:16:44.449"
"so I go here f(xi*) ","00:16:44.449","00:16:48.100"
"f(xi*) what's my function ","00:16:48.100","00:16:51.610"
"it's 3-- it's x-3. So I have to take ","00:16:51.610","00:16:55.670"
"the argument minus 3","00:16:55.670","00:16:59.579"
"and that's equal to 1+3i","00:16:59.579","00:17:02.980"
"over n minus 3, and that's equal to ","00:17:02.980","00:17:06.360"
"3i/n-2","00:17:06.360","00:17:11.230"
"okay so I evaluated my function","00:17:11.230","00:17:14.579"
"at all the sampling points ","00:17:14.579","00:17:19.400"
"and now I'm ready to use a definition","00:17:19.400","00:17:26.300"
"please ask me questions at any time","00:17:26.300","00:17:33.300"
"so we write down from 1 to 4","00:17:38.100","00:17:41.960"
"(x-3)dx","00:17:41.960","00:17:45.169"
"this is the integral we're trying to evaluate. This is the limit ","00:17:45.169","00:17:49.640"
"as n goes to infinity of the Reimann sum","00:17:49.640","00:17:54.960"
"and under the sum I have ","00:17:54.960","00:17:58.300"
"f(xi*), that's the expression I got. 3i/n","00:17:58.300","00:18:01.740"
"minus 2","00:18:01.740","00:18:06.220"
"times delta x. That's 3","00:18:06.220","00:18:10.330"
"over n. So again, this is f","00:18:10.330","00:18:13.600"
"f(xi*) and this is ","00:18:13.600","00:18:16.960"
"delta x","00:18:16.960","00:18:20.210"
"so now I have concrete numbers in the formulas ","00:18:20.210","00:18:24.110"
"and I have to evaluate first the sum","00:18:24.110","00:18:28.190"
"and then the limit, okay","00:18:28.190","00:18:32.460"
"so I continue to write limit","00:18:32.460","00:18:36.750"
"so to evaluate this sum ","00:18:36.750","00:18:40.179"
"this is a constant. It doesn't depend on i","00:18:40.179","00:18:44.050"
"so this guy can actually come out here","00:18:44.050","00:18:47.510"
"so I have 3/n and here I have a sum ","00:18:47.510","00:18:53.179"
"of 3i/n","00:18:53.179","00:18:56.490"
"minus 2","00:18:56.490","00:19:00.169"
"okay. The next step ","00:19:00.169","00:19:06.730"
"I'm going to split this in to two sums.","00:19:06.730","00:19:13.730"
"I'm going to have a sum of 3i","00:19:15.120","00:19:19.150"
"over n minus... like this ","00:19:19.150","00:19:26.150"
"next I notice that","00:19:26.640","00:19:33.640"
"in this sum I have i times a constant, 3/n. So ","00:19:36.840","00:19:41.460"
"this constant. This constant can come out","00:19:41.460","00:19:48.460"
"so I have","00:19:50.870","00:19:56.200"
"3/n","00:19:56.200","00:19:59.530"
"the sum of i, and this I can rewrite as 2","00:19:59.530","00:20:05.730"
"the sum of one ","00:20:05.730","00:20:09.880"
"questions? So I simplify that","00:20:09.880","00:20:16.880"
"as much as I could. And now I have ","00:20:19.300","00:20:23.090"
"two sums, and both of them we're going to ","00:20:23.090","00:20:26.590"
"evaluate. The first sum ","00:20:26.590","00:20:29.950"
"so let's do it here ","00:20:29.950","00:20:33.980"
"what does this stand for? This stands for ","00:20:33.980","00:20:37.600"
"one plus two plus three plus four, and so on","00:20:37.600","00:20:40.830"
"all the way to n, that is called an arithmatic progression ","00:20:40.830","00:20:44.370"
"and we have a formula for it, right? ","00:20:44.370","00:20:48.040"
"you don't have to remember this formula, but you must have seen it ","00:20:48.040","00:20:52.940"
"before in some class or another. Okay","00:20:52.940","00:20:57.200"
"and this one, I want you to tell me what this one is equal to ","00:20:57.200","00:21:04.200"
"So either one or n. So what do we do here? ","00:21:04.300","00:21:07.600"
"this is a machine. We have to take it and add it for each i ","00:21:07.600","00:21:11.160"
"i goes from 1 to n, so we are going to add this thing together ","00:21:11.160","00:21:15.490"
"n times. So we'll go 1 +1 +1 +1 +1","00:21:15.490","00:21:19.060"
"n times. So this is n","00:21:19.060","00:21:23.080"
"questions? So I evaluated both of these objects. So this ","00:21:23.080","00:21:29.120"
"n(n+1)","00:21:29.120","00:21:32.750"
"over 2, this is n ","00:21:32.750","00:21:36.550"
"so I continue here","00:21:36.550","00:21:40.070"
"limit as n goes to infinity ","00:21:40.070","00:21:43.540"
"I have to collect everything I have here
so 3/n","00:21:43.540","00:21:47.030"
"3 over","00:21:47.030","00:21:51.030"
"n, n(n+1) ","00:21:51.030","00:21:54.290"
"over 2 minus 2 ","00:21:54.290","00:21:58.050"
"n. Okay. ","00:21:58.050","00:22:01.430"
"so something is going to simplify. I am going to ","00:22:01.430","00:22:05.150"
"divide through by n. One second","00:22:05.150","00:22:12.150"
"so 3","00:22:20.830","00:22:26.210"
"this n cancels, and I'm dividing by n ","00:22:26.210","00:22:29.380"
"so I have 1+1/n over 2","00:22:29.380","00:22:33.800"
"minus 2","00:22:33.800","00:22:37.550"
"okay, dividing through by n","00:22:37.550","00:22:41.990"
"all the terms. And now I can take the limit ","00:22:41.990","00:22:45.940"
"I do this in order to take the limit. The limit is easy ","00:22:45.940","00:22:49.480"
"because 1/n goes to zero as n becomes large ","00:22:49.480","00:22:52.870"
"so this is 0","00:22:52.870","00:22:56.200"
"so I have 3 times 3 halves ","00:22:56.200","00:22:59.940"
"-2 so this is the answer I get","00:22:59.940","00:23:06.940"
"and we'll go here. See? ","00:23:09.480","00:23:14.130"
"It's the same thing. So you can see two methods, right? This is ","00:23:14.130","00:23:19.750"
"done very quickly this is long and
painful","00:23:19.750","00:23:23.130"
"but we could only do this because these were triangles ","00:23:23.130","00:23:26.720"
"right? This new definition","00:23:26.720","00:23:30.950"
"eventually will give us a tool to evaluate the area under  ","00:23:30.950","00:23:34.750"
"curves. Not just straight lines. Question? ","00:23:34.750","00:23:39.230"
"student: how did you divide everything by adding it? ","00:23:39.230","00:23:42.620"
"So here, let's write this ","00:23:42.620","00:23:45.680"
"I have 3, this n cancels","00:23:45.680","00:23:50.150"
"so I have 3, and I divide by n ","00:23:50.150","00:23:53.920"
"here. n+1 over n ","00:23:53.920","00:23:57.700"
"2, right? And ","00:23:57.700","00:24:00.840"
"n from here, ","00:24:00.840","00:24:04.890"
"I get this. ","00:24:04.890","00:24:08.540"
"more questions?","00:24:08.540","00:24:15.540"
"okay","00:24:17.220","00:24:19.670"
"very good ","00:24:19.670","00:24:21.770"
"so ","00:24:21.770","00:24:27.740"
"it is actually very rare when we can complete this calculation ","00:24:27.740","00:24:32.200"
"and get the exact numerical answer","00:24:32.200","00:24:36.180"
"again, this was possible because it's such  a simple function ","00:24:36.180","00:24:40.640"
"so sometimes it make sense to
approximate","00:24:40.640","00:24:43.900"
"let's not calculate this...the limit ","00:24:43.900","00:24:48.430"
"but we can get an approximate answer ","00:24:48.430","00:24:51.750"
"Okay. So in order to do this, we introduce ","00:24:51.750","00:24:57.210"
"the midpoint rule","00:24:57.210","00:25:04.210"
"so simply put ","00:25:10.650","00:25:14.430"
"this rule allows me to approximate this
integral","00:25:14.430","00:25:21.370"
"by a finite sum","00:25:21.370","00:25:25.450"
"both","00:25:30.090","00:25:33.970"
"of f of xi bar ","00:25:33.970","00:25:37.280"
"delta x, sorry, delta x. ","00:25:37.280","00:25:42.090"
"What's xi bar? So let's ","00:25:42.090","00:25:45.560"
"draw one of the intervals ","00:25:45.560","00:25:48.910"
"from xi-1 to xi. Remember the right point rule ","00:25:48.910","00:25:53.560"
"we take our sampling point here. Left point rule, we take it here. ","00:25:53.560","00:25:57.220"
"midpoint rule, we use the middle. So ","00:25:57.220","00:26:00.900"
"so we say that xi*","00:26:00.900","00:26:04.190"
"simply equals xi bar ","00:26:04.190","00:26:07.460"
"where it's the middle point. xi bar ","00:26:07.460","00:26:10.750"
"xi","00:26:10.750","00:26:14.470"
"okay","00:26:14.470","00:26:17.680"
" ","00:26:17.680","00:26:22.110"
"is it me? no okay","00:26:22.110","00:26:26.490"
"fine. ","00:26:26.490","00:26:30.210"
"So this is the midpoint, and thus the name ","00:26:30.210","00:26:34.230"
"was a question? okay. ","00:26:34.230","00:26:39.440"
"was that music? ","00:26:39.440","00:26:42.160"
"so this is the midpoint and let you","00:26:50.130","00:26:54.320"
"let me give you an example of how we can apply this rule to approximate ","00:26:54.320","00:26:58.710"
"a particular integral. So approximate the integral from 0 to 1","00:26:59.600","00:27:08.550"
"x^2 dx","00:27:08.550","00:27:12.070"
"with n = 4","00:27:12.070","00:27:15.740"
"by using","00:27:15.740","00:27:19.140"
"the midpoint ","00:27:19.140","00:27:24.320"
"rule. So let's draw ","00:27:24.320","00:27:29.050"
"every time they ask you to evaluate ","00:27:29.050","00:27:32.400"
"the Reinmann sum. The best thing to do is to draw your interval ","00:27:32.400","00:27:37.290"
" actually right down the partition","00:27:37.290","00:27:41.290"
"find the sampling points. Do it systematically, and then it's very easy ","00:27:41.290","00:27:45.190"
"so we go from 0 to 1","00:27:45.190","00:27:48.540"
"they specify","00:27:48.540","00:27:51.690"
"n = 4. So this means that we divide it in to 4","00:27:51.690","00:27:55.370"
"subintervals. This is 1/2","00:27:55.370","00:27:58.820"
"one-quarter, three quarters. Four ","00:27:58.820","00:28:02.020"
"intervals. Now we have to find the sampling point ","00:28:02.020","00:28:06.100"
"Which has to be the middle point, because we are using the midpoint rule ","00:28:06.100","00:28:10.510"
"so this one here, x1 bar ","00:28:10.510","00:28:14.530"
"what is it equal to? 1 over 8","00:28:14.530","00:28:18.850"
"okay, x2 bar ","00:28:18.850","00:28:23.160"
"is 3 over 8","00:28:23.160","00:28:26.600"
"x3 bar ","00:28:26.600","00:28:30.730"
"5 over 8","00:28:30.730","00:28:36.250"
"and x4 bar is 7 over 8","00:28:36.250","00:28:39.570"
"questions? ","00:28:39.570","00:28:44.420"
"So we know our points, just put it here. ","00:28:44.420","00:28:51.420"
"we have to evaluate the function at these four points. And the function is x^2","00:28:56.960","00:29:00.840"
"so f(x) ","00:29:00.840","00:29:03.920"
"is x^2. So ","00:29:03.920","00:29:07.130"
"f(xi) is just xi^2","00:29:07.130","00:29:10.540"
"so we can say that the integral from 0
to 1","00:29:10.540","00:29:15.030"
"x^2dx is approximately equal to ","00:29:15.030","00:29:18.270"
"okay, each term here","00:29:18.270","00:29:21.860"
"will contain the multiplier delta X","00:29:21.860","00:29:25.010"
"so I'm going to take it out of the bracket ","00:29:25.010","00:29:29.290"
"and I forgot to calculate delta x. So ","00:29:29.290","00:29:32.320"
"what's delta x here? ","00:29:32.320","00:29:35.610"
"what is the distance between my ","00:29:35.610","00:29:39.920"
"points in the partition? One quarter, right? ","00:29:39.920","00:29:43.530"
"n=4, the total interval is one, so it's one quarter. ","00:29:43.530","00:29:47.020"
"so I have one quarter that comes out","00:29:47.020","00:29:50.990"
"and here I have the sum","00:29:50.990","00:29:54.470"
"f1-- oh, f","00:29:54.470","00:29:57.900"
"x1, x2","00:29:57.900","00:30:02.970"
"x3, ","00:30:02.970","00:30:06.830"
"x4. So one quarter ","00:30:06.830","00:30:11.070"
"of one","00:30:11.070","00:30:14.190"
"over eight squared, 3 over 8","00:30:14.190","00:30:18.250"
"squared, 5 over 8","00:30:18.250","00:30:21.920"
"squared, seven over 8","00:30:21.920","00:30:25.390"
"squared. So if you ","00:30:25.390","00:30:31.270"
"put it in your calculators, maybe one of you can do it here, if you have a ","00:30:31.270","00:30:34.390"
"calculator","00:30:34.390","00:30:35.010"
"we're going to evaluate this number and see how good ","00:30:35.010","00:30:40.170"
"this approximation is to this integral ","00:30:40.170","00:30:43.680"
"what is the exact value of this integral? 1/3.","00:30:43.680","00:30:48.340"
"We did it last time, right? So this is going to be ","00:30:48.340","00:30:51.640"
"something like 0.32","00:30:51.640","00:30:55.320"
"I believe something like this. So it's not going to be precisely ","00:30:55.320","00:30:58.870"
"the exact value, but it's going to approximate it ","00:30:58.870","00:31:03.200"
"and if we take a higher n, we will get a better answer","00:31:03.200","00:31:07.330"
"okay. Questions? Question? ","00:31:07.330","00:31:14.330"
"Student: ""the 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, where do they come from?""","00:31:15.150","00:31:19.480"
"Where do they come from? So these are these values  ","00:31:19.480","00:31:25.110"
"Okay. These are the sampling points for each interval ","00:31:25.110","00:31:29.270"
"I have to take the middle point and evaluate my function ","00:31:29.270","00:31:32.780"
"at that point so if I use different
color","00:31:32.780","00:31:38.630"
"inside each interval ","00:31:38.630","00:31:42.620"
"I calculated the middle ","00:31:42.620","00:31:45.960"
"of that interval. So my first interval goes from 0 to one quarter ","00:31:45.960","00:31:49.020"
"I only have four intervals, this, this, this and this. ","00:31:49.020","00:31:52.250"
"for the first interval, the middle corresponds to 1/8","00:31:52.250","00:31:55.780"
"I have to evaluate my function at that point ","00:31:55.780","00:31:58.800"
"the function is x^2, so the function evaluated at that point ","00:31:58.800","00:32:03.540"
"is 1/8 squared. That's the first ","00:32:03.540","00:32:06.840"
"term. Then I have to take the second inerval","00:32:06.840","00:32:10.010"
"its middle is given by 3/8, the function ","00:32:10.010","00:32:13.110"
"at that point is given by 3/8 squared","00:32:13.110","00:32:16.780"
"and so on. I add them up. More questions? ","00:32:16.780","00:32:23.780"
"So next let's go over some ","00:32:25.890","00:32:29.310"
"properties of definite integrals ","00:32:29.310","00:32:36.310"
"so the first property I write down here ","00:33:24.490","00:33:28.430"
"the integral from ","00:33:28.430","00:33:31.510"
"a to b f(x)","00:33:31.510","00:33:35.440"
"dx. The limits of integration, a to b","00:33:35.440","00:33:38.720"
"can be...can be swapped ","00:33:38.720","00:33:41.880"
"and we actually can go from b to a ","00:33:41.880","00:33:45.080"
"so if a is less than b, we can go this way ","00:33:45.080","00:33:49.320"
"or we can go the other way ","00:33:49.320","00:33:55.980"
"but the corresponding integral ","00:33:55.980","00:33:59.370"
"acquires a negative sign. Why is that? Because when we go","00:33:59.370","00:34:03.880"
"in the positive direction, the increment, delta x, ","00:34:03.880","00:34:07.450"
"is a positive quantity. When we go back, ","00:34:07.450","00:34:11.140"
"the value decreases .So the increment is negative. Okay? ","00:34:11.140","00:34:14.760"
"so if you look at the Reimann sum ","00:34:14.760","00:34:19.169"
"you end up multiplying by a negative value, delta x.  ","00:34:19.169","00:34:22.640"
"so we have a minus sign here. Something that immediately follows from this ","00:34:22.640","00:34:28.270"
"is the following: the integral","00:34:28.270","00:34:32.350"
"of f(x)dx from a to a-- what's that equal to?","00:34:32.350","00:34:36.360"
"0. Two reasons for this: the first reason","00:34:36.360","00:34:40.169"
"comes from this formula if I take them
both to be a","00:34:40.169","00:34:43.679"
"then this is equal to minus the same thing, so this can only be zero  ","00:34:43.679","00:34:48.330"
"the other reason","00:34:48.330","00:34:52.320"
"is that we're considering a the area
under a curve","00:34:52.320","00:34:55.750"
"of an infinitely thin ","00:34:55.750","00:34:59.060"
"base. So it has to be zero, right? ","00:34:59.060","00:35:03.500"
"okay","00:35:03.500","00:35:06.540"
"so then let's list","00:35:06.540","00:35:12.360"
"a bunch of properties that will help us evaluate","00:35:12.360","00:35:17.270"
"very many integrals and Riemann sums, too ","00:35:17.270","00:35:21.920"
"so property number 1 states","00:35:21.920","00:35:25.640"
"the integral","00:35:25.640","00:35:28.850"
"of a constant and it's equal to this ","00:35:28.850","00:35:35.850"
"so let's suppose that my function","00:35:35.960","00:35:40.470"
"is the constant, c","00:35:40.470","00:35:44.800"
"which can be negative or positive ","00:35:44.800","00:35:48.340"
"so then this object on the left","00:35:48.340","00:35:52.350"
"its either the area under this curve","00:35:52.350","00:35:55.890"
"if this is a positive constant or it's the area above that curve ","00:35:55.890","00:36:00.180"
"with a minus sign, so it's the same thing, and this is a rectangle  ","00:36:00.180","00:36:05.440"
"so the area is equal to b-a","00:36:05.440","00:36:08.950"
"times C. and that's what we have here ","00:36:08.950","00:36:12.310"
"on the right hand side. Okay? So it's very easy ","00:36:12.310","00:36:15.960"
"to evaluate the definite integral of a
constant because it comes from this","00:36:15.960","00:36:20.210"
"geometric ","00:36:20.210","00:36:21.020"
"consideration. Questions? ","00:36:21.020","00:36:26.320"
"Okay. The next one talks about ","00:36:26.320","00:36:30.910"
"the integral of a sum ","00:36:30.910","00:36:34.510"
"of two functions. So here, both f and g","00:36:34.510","00:36:38.390"
"are functions of x. Question? Student: just to make sure, I can't see. Is that an equal sign? ","00:36:38.390","00:36:44.250"
"here yes. Student: So that only works","00:36:44.250","00:36:47.870"
"it works if-- oh, I see. nevermind. It works for both positive ","00:36:47.870","00:36:53.520"
"and negative values of C and also for C=0","00:36:53.520","00:37:00.520"
"So if I have a sum of two functions, then I can evaluate ","00:37:01.700","00:37:06.860"
"the integral separately. It's fdx","00:37:06.860","00:37:10.220"
"plus gdx","00:37:10.220","00:37:13.480"
"gdx. How do I know this? ","00:37:13.480","00:37:20.480"
"this is very easy to prove ","00:37:20.740","00:37:25.130"
"all I need to do is recall the definition","00:37:25.130","00:37:32.130"
"okay","00:37:38.120","00:37:42.840"
"so this is the definition of the integral f(x) ","00:37:42.840","00:37:46.320"
"so I can replace f with f+g","00:37:46.320","00:37:51.100"
"then I'll have f+g here ","00:37:51.100","00:37:55.270"
"so I can split this sum in to two sums ","00:37:55.270","00:37:58.580"
"one was f, the other one was g. Then I can evaluate  ","00:37:58.580","00:38:02.970"
"the limits separately. The limit for the f sum plus the limit for the g sum","00:38:02.970","00:38:07.410"
"and that's equal to these two things ","00:38:07.410","00:38:10.750"
"Okay? So I'm sorry, I shouldn't forget","00:38:10.750","00:38:13.870"
"to put the limits of integration. Because what I just wrote actually as a very","00:38:13.870","00:38:20.530"
"different meaning. That's the antiderivative, that's not what I'm talking about here ","00:38:20.530","00:38:24.560"
"Okay. Property number 3: the integral of a constant","00:38:24.560","00:38:29.160"
"times a function","00:38:29.160","00:38:32.250"
"is given by the same constant","00:38:32.250","00:38:38.660"
"times the integral over the function","00:38:38.660","00:38:43.670"
"Proof? You go here again. If we have c times f here ","00:38:43.670","00:38:48.900"
"then we have c times f here. c comes out of the sum","00:38:48.900","00:38:52.760"
"c comes out of the limit, in order to have a c","00:38:52.760","00:38:56.370"
"times this which is given","00:38:56.370","00:39:00.690"
"by the integral times c","00:39:00.690","00:39:06.160"
"okay, and finally property number ","00:39:06.160","00:39:09.760"
"4 I'm not sure why it's listed as a
separate property in the book","00:39:09.760","00:39:15.970"
"but i's the integral","00:39:15.970","00:39:19.750"
"of the difference between two functions ","00:39:19.750","00:39:24.120"
"it actually follows from properties 2&amp;3","00:39:24.120","00:39:28.400"
"but I'll write it down nonetheless","00:39:28.400","00:39:33.720"
"so the integral of a difference is the difference between the two integrals ","00:39:33.720","00:39:40.170"
"and next we apply all these rules ","00:39:40.170","00:39:43.420"
"to calculate an example","00:39:43.420","00:39:50.420"
"so let's look at the integral from 0 to 1","00:40:10.570","00:40:12.970"
"5+2","00:40:12.970","00:40:16.020"
"x^2dx","00:40:16.020","00:40:19.310"
"so one way to approach it will be to","00:40:19.310","00:40:23.200"
"do it by definition. Write down the limit of a sum","00:40:23.200","00:40:27.280"
"of this thing, create a partition ","00:40:27.280","00:40:31.120"
"calculate sampling points and then do the sums and then the limit ","00:40:31.120","00:40:34.530"
"it's very, very tedious. We're going to do the same thing ","00:40:34.530","00:40:38.190"
"by using the rules so we notice","00:40:38.190","00:40:41.710"
"that the integrand is a sum of two functions ","00:40:41.710","00:40:45.650"
"so by rule number two I'm going to
present it as the sum","00:40:45.650","00:40:51.530"
"of two integrals. ","00:40:51.530","00:40:58.530"
"So this is rule number 2. I can","00:41:00.610","00:41:06.080"
"evaluated separately. Okay, now ","00:41:06.080","00:41:10.570"
"the first one, we have to look at rule number 1","00:41:10.570","00:41:14.320"
"which is a constant, right? ","00:41:14.320","00:41:19.520"
"we have five here so","00:41:19.520","00:41:22.800"
"we have five","00:41:22.800","00:41:27.800"
"times 1 minus 0. And that's by rule number one ","00:41:27.800","00:41:31.770"
"so I dealt with this one nicely. ","00:41:31.770","00:41:35.050"
"Now this one we have to look at rule number 3.","00:41:35.050","00:41:39.410"
"we have a constant inside, 2","00:41:39.410","00:41:43.660"
"comes out. So we have 2 ","00:41:43.660","00:41:49.800"
"so this","00:41:49.800","00:41:54.150"
"is rule number 3. So what's this equal to? ","00:41:54.150","00:41:58.900"
"I already asked you like five times today. ","00:41:58.900","00:42:02.070"
"1/3, right? ","00:42:02.070","00:42:05.550"
"so we're going to use this fact to write down the answer","00:42:05.550","00:42:08.760"
"Okay? Very easy. ","00:42:21.160","00:42:25.030"
"So if we can decompose it somehow","00:42:25.030","00:42:29.000"
"and follow different rules, we can ","00:42:29.000","00:42:32.100"
"evaluate integrals easily. Questions? ","00:42:32.100","00:42:36.640"
"now rule ","00:42:36.640","00:42:41.670"
"property number five ","00:42:41.670","00:42:46.080"
"let's suppose that I have are","00:42:46.080","00:42:49.850"
"an interval from a to b ","00:42:49.850","00:42:54.290"
"and I look","00:42:54.290","00:42:57.590"
"at an integral of fdx--","00:42:57.590","00:43:01.190"
"of x dx, and I ","00:43:01.190","00:43:04.780"
"define another point, C","00:43:04.780","00:43:08.050"
"which may or may not be between a and b ","00:43:08.050","00:43:11.550"
"actually, it could be anywhere else. Then I can rewrite this integral","00:43:11.550","00:43:17.130"
"as the sum of the integral from a to c","00:43:18.040","00:43:21.120"
"plus an integral from c","00:43:21.120","00:43:25.020"
"to b. ","00:43:25.020","00:43:32.020"
"I will illustrate this with a picture ","00:43:33.470","00:43:40.470"
"let's suppose for simplicity that f is positive ","00:43:44.890","00:43:48.840"
"and the quantity on the left is ","00:43:48.840","00:43:52.190"
"has the meaning of the integral under the curve. Question? Student:  ""just want to make sure we're on the same page. C is","00:43:52.190","00:43:56.410"
"between a and b?"" It doesn't have to be. So in this example it is  ","00:43:56.410","00:43:59.620"
"but in general it doesn't have to be. It's just another constant. ","00:43:59.620","00:44:04.580"
"So... and you can prove it, of course. Here we illustrated it with an example that ","00:44:04.580","00:44:09.230"
"is more obvious","00:44:09.230","00:44:09.970"
"on the left we have the area under this curve. ","00:44:09.970","00:44:14.750"
"the whole thing. Now on the right, we have two integrals ","00:44:14.750","00:44:19.890"
"which is this area and this area","00:44:19.890","00:44:24.800"
"you add up the two, and ","00:44:24.800","00:44:28.950"
"you get the full thing. Okay? So this is the","00:44:28.950","00:44:34.560"
"the meaning of this property as an
example for instance we can say that","00:44:34.560","00:44:41.560"
"we can write this down ","00:44:50.860","00:44:52.890"
"as the integral from 0 to 1","00:44:52.890","00:44:59.330"
"1 to five. So this is an example ","00:44:59.330","00:45:05.850"
"Okay. Question? ","00:45:05.850","00:45:12.850"
"Student: can you draw an example where c is not between a and b? ","00:45:13.690","00:45:17.240"
"Yes. So let's consider the following geometry ","00:45:17.240","00:45:21.680"
"a, b, c","00:45:21.680","00:45:25.270"
"so","00:45:25.270","00:45:28.420"
"we have to assume","00:45:28.420","00:45:31.870"
"in this case that f is actually defined ","00:45:31.870","00:45:35.640"
"for the whole interval. Okay, so if f only exists here, ","00:45:35.640","00:45:39.630"
"we cannot do this. but if c is in the domain","00:45:39.630","00:45:43.560"
"of f, then we can potentially ","00:45:43.560","00:45:46.860"
"define c to not belong to this interval. ","00:45:46.860","00:45:52.050"
"so, so this is my function f","00:45:52.050","00:45:55.630"
"okay","00:45:55.630","00:46:00.120"
"so I have an integral from a to b ","00:46:00.120","00:46:03.980"
"fdx is equal to ","00:46:03.980","00:46:07.660"
"from a to c fdx","00:46:07.660","00:46:11.450"
"from c to b dx.","00:46:11.450","00:46:18.450"
"Now let's simplify this. So first of all, ","00:46:19.220","00:46:23.840"
"this first interval ","00:46:23.840","00:46:27.050"
"I'm going to use this rule and flip the limits ","00:46:27.050","00:46:30.970"
"so I get","00:46:30.970","00:46:34.090"
"abfdx","00:46:34.090","00:46:37.340"
"is minus from c","00:46:37.340","00:46:40.710"
"to a fdx","00:46:40.710","00:46:45.570"
"now the second integral spans ","00:46:45.570","00:46:48.770"
"the interval from c to b. okay? ","00:46:48.770","00:46:52.440"
"so I'm going to split this one in to this plus this ","00:46:52.440","00:46:55.710"
"so instead of this integral I'm going to write ","00:46:55.710","00:46:59.230"
"from c to a fdx","00:46:59.230","00:47:02.740"
"plus from a to b","00:47:02.740","00:47:06.010"
"fdx. Right? ","00:47:06.010","00:47:09.360"
"now you can see that this","00:47:09.360","00:47:12.460"
"the first and the second terms cancel
out and I get that identity","00:47:12.460","00:47:18.340"
"the left hand side is equal to the right hand side ","00:47:18.340","00:47:21.550"
"so it's a little bit more... less obvious
but it also works","00:47:21.550","00:47:25.530"
"more questions? Okay.","00:47:25.530","00:47:30.280"
"Finally, the last ","00:47:30.280","00:47:34.010"
"group of properties is called comparative properties ","00:47:34.010","00:47:38.450"
"they are","00:47:50.190","00:47:56.580"
"numbered from 6 to 8, So let's suppose that f ","00:47:56.580","00:48:01.610"
"is non-negative","00:48:01.610","00:48:05.640"
"then the integral from a to b f(x) ","00:48:05.640","00:48:11.630"
"dx is non-negative. This is obvious","00:48:11.630","00:48:16.060"
"because for non-negative fs","00:48:16.060","00:48:19.680"
"the integral is nothing but the area under the curve, and that's a non-","00:48:19.680","00:48:23.320"
"quantity. Okay? So we already know this. ","00:48:23.320","00:48:27.290"
"fine","00:48:27.290","00:48:30.720"
"number seven let's suppose that we have
two functions","00:48:30.720","00:48:35.160"
"and one of them is bigger than the other ","00:48:35.160","00:48:39.590"
"on the same, you know ","00:48:39.590","00:48:43.610"
"interval. Then we can compare ","00:48:43.610","00:48:46.650"
"the integral of f was the integral ","00:48:46.650","00:48:51.930"
"of g. The function is bigger ","00:48:51.930","00:48:57.120"
"and then the integral is bigger too. Let me illustrate this ","00:48:57.120","00:49:01.100"
"with an example","00:49:01.100","00:49:08.100"
"Let's suppose that both functions are ","00:49:17.950","00:49:19.970"
"non-negative, okay? For simplicity. So this is the larger of the functions, f","00:49:19.970","00:49:26.970"
"and this is g","00:49:27.739","00:49:32.799"
"okay? Between a and b","00:49:32.799","00:49:35.849"
"so the integral of f is this whole area ","00:49:35.849","00:49:40.190"
"and the integral of g is part of it ","00:49:45.069","00:49:49.190"
"right so you can see that the area under
the function g is smaller than the area","00:49:49.190","00:49:53.970"
"under the function f, ","00:49:53.970","00:49:54.739"
"and that's exactly what this says. Okay? ","00:49:54.739","00:49:59.799"
"this only works if f is greater than g. If they intersect somewhere, ","00:49:59.799","00:50:05.130"
"then we cannot make this conclusion
finally","00:50:05.130","00:50:09.880"
"the last property","00:50:09.880","00:50:13.980"
"property 8","00:50:13.980","00:50:17.339"
"Is like this. Let's suppose that we have two numbers ","00:50:17.339","00:50:20.970"
"m little and M capital ","00:50:20.970","00:50:27.970"
"Which work like this. so this is my function from a to b","00:50:28.900","00:50:36.400"
"and there's some value, m","00:50:36.400","00:50:40.150"
"and another one, M capital ","00:50:40.150","00:50:43.700"
"such that they enclose this function. One is always smaller ","00:50:43.700","00:50:46.829"
"than my function, and the other one is always larger ","00:50:46.829","00:50:49.829"
"for all values of x on the interval. Okay? Let's suppose I know ","00:50:49.829","00:50:53.759"
"that these two numbers exist.","00:50:53.759","00:50:57.349"
"make an estimate of the integral of f","00:50:57.349","00:51:01.450"
"okay? I know what it's bigger than and I know what it's smaller than ","00:51:01.450","00:51:05.059"
"what are these things? So the","00:51:05.059","00:51:09.410"
"integral of f is this area ","00:51:09.410","00:51:12.410"
"now look at this  box here","00:51:12.410","00:51:16.009"
"this is completely contained inside","00:51:16.009","00:51:20.819"
"this bigger area, and the area of this box ","00:51:20.819","00:51:25.989"
"is m times b-a. ","00:51:25.989","00:51:32.989"
"well I can see that the it","00:51:36.049","00:51:40.259"
"into love F youth gonna the smaller","00:51:40.259","00:51:43.259"
"done that this box on the other hand","00:51:43.259","00:51:47.190"
"but those are the books this on the
aerial the box","00:51:47.190","00:51:54.190"
"you buy em capital you minus a in a
completely contains","00:51:55.900","00:51:59.940"
"then the growth","00:51:59.940","00:52:03.759"
"so I can have there's bound the upper
bound on the bill","00:52:03.759","00:52:08.380"
"so a I will say this was a an example
and then I let you go","00:52:08.380","00:52:14.140"
"game","00:52:14.140","00:52:21.140"
"example like this","00:52:28.180","00:52:32.600"
"fifth find the %uh","00:52:32.600","00:52:35.910"
"so the integral","00:52:35.910","00:52:40.450"
"from 0 to 1/4","00:52:40.450","00:52:43.730"
"0 he to the Linus affects squared yes","00:52:43.730","00:52:47.860"
"so at this stage we have no idea","00:52:47.860","00:52:51.170"
"what this alias but got but I can read
it down a double in the quality","00:52:51.170","00:52:55.210"
"that defines what it is so","00:52:55.210","00:52:58.260"
"let's blow this function it some taking
functional X","00:52:58.260","00:53:01.340"
"day because you're a and one a","00:53:01.340","00:53:05.620"
"when ethical 0 itself is equal to 1","00:53:05.620","00:53:09.810"
"in 1x chemical 21 it's now the is","00:53:09.810","00:53:15.080"
"E to the -1 Pratt so for sure","00:53:15.080","00:53:18.870"
"I can write down the bowling double
inequality","00:53:18.870","00:53:22.950"
"he to the -1 is almost","00:53:22.950","00:53:25.970"
"less or equal to you to the minus
excluded and thus always less or equal","00:53:25.970","00:53:30.370"
"to what","00:53:30.370","00:53:30.920"
"so this function that lot","00:53:30.920","00:53:34.490"
"is bounded between if -1 which is
something like one quarter","00:53:34.490","00:53:38.580"
"and one someone to use proper 28","00:53:38.580","00:53:41.990"
"to a evaluate","00:53:41.990","00:53:45.520"
"I the bounds for this and I'll","00:53:45.520","00:53:49.140"
"on the left I'm gonna have you to the -1","00:53:49.140","00:53:52.450"
"times 110","00:53:52.450","00:53:55.960"
"and on the right they have one so","00:53:55.960","00:53:59.830"
"to conclude well I know","00:53:59.830","00:54:04.360"
"that this integral is between one
already","00:54:04.360","00:54:07.440"
"and one and this is much more
information","00:54:07.440","00:54:11.460"
"than I get by just looking at this rate","00:54:11.460","00:54:14.900"
"thank you much","00:54:14.900","00:54:17.150"
