"Another fabulous visit!","In this dreary time both in terms of weather and Covid-19 it was a relief to go out for a few hours and virtually forget what’s currently dominating the news. We visited today for lunch and I cannot fault the safety measures, staff friendliness, quality of food and good value. We were there for over two hours and never felt rushed and had such a relaxed meal. According to my husband , the Baked Alaska for two was amazing and could have fed 4 never mind 2! Seriously cannot wait to return as soon as we are able !","October 2020","The Grill on the Square","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190764-d1817253-Reviews-The_Grill_on_the_Square-Warrington_Cheshire_England.html","Warrington, United Kingdom","restaurants","5.0","4.5"

"Poor service takes the shine away","Firstly I want to say that the food was excellent and so much better than usual pub food. It was presented beautifully and tasted fresh and full of flavour. There was nothing that I could criticise at all. However the service was extremely poor. We had our dog with us so we’re in the bar area which was no problem at all to us but as we had been put in the rod room it felt that we were just forgotten about. We were there over 2 hours having had just 2 courses. We had to go and find someone to order more drinks, order puddings, get the bill. It really did feel as if we were ‘out of sight, out of mind. The rod room did just feel like a bit of a back office. As I said the food was beautiful but we probably wouldn’t return due to the service.","September 2020","Half Moon Inn","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1924862-d1739251-Reviews-Half_Moon_Inn-Sheepwash_Devon_England.html","Sheepwash, United Kingdom","hotels","3.0","4.5"
"First class","From the moment you step in you are welcomed like an old friend. Every person says hello whether or not they are waiting on you. The menu is amazing and it was really difficult to choose. I finally settled on the oriental duck spring roll and then the venison. It was truly stunning! I don’t usually have a dessert but found it difficult to say no and had the cherry Bakewell tart. There are absolutely no negatives to this place and I can’t wait to return. The COVID precautions make you feel very safe and are well adhered to as well","August 2020","La Boheme","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1499256-d2101662-Reviews-La_Boheme-Lymm_Warrington_Cheshire_England.html","Lymm, United Kingdom","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Second to none!","We visited recently as part of the Eat out to Help out scheme. We had booked in advance as we knew it could be busy. The staff were helpful explains the way the restaurant works with all the COVID restrictions and we felt perfectly safe. The menu was gorgeous. I had the carrot and apricot chutney tart, my husband had the duo of lamb and my father-in-law had the gammon. The food was amazing and generous portions.

"Fine dining on the go!","We were attracted to this place due to the constant queue every time we went past. We weren’t disappointed at all. We had the fish cakes with sweet chilli mayonnaise, cous cous and coleslaw. It was divine and very filling. As the weather was good we were fine sitting outside. I can imagine if it’s raining it’s a bit more tricky.

"Lovely beach but very busy","Very busy when we visited. The car park was totally overwhelmed and people seemed to be parking anywhere. The beach itself was the busiest we visited in the area and although it was beautiful I would choose others (Clachtoll) over this one because of that. It could have been because of all the staycationers due to COVID though. The beach is stunning though and we had a lovely walk across the hills with the dogs","August 2020","Achmelvich Bay","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g319813-d10642334-Reviews-Achmelvich_Bay-Lochinver_Caithness_and_Sutherland_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html","Lochinver, United Kingdom","attractions","4.0","4.5"

"Short visit only","Due to COVID the cafe and visitor centre were closed. There was a small takeaway selling drinks and lunches though so that was ok. The actual Falls are viewed from a platform and although it was quiet we still had to wait to watch for salmon. We saw plenty of salmon but felt we couldn’t linger as there were people waiting. Went on the ‘green’ route walk which was pleasant although not very taxing. Overall, a nice place for an hour or so.","August 2020","Falls of Shin","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635690-d1184169-Reviews-Falls_of_Shin-Lairg_Caithness_and_Sutherland_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html","Lairg, United Kingdom","attractions","3.0","4.0"
"Sadly not dog friendly","The gorge itself is beautiful and an easy path leads you down to the bridge. Only 6 people at a time were allowed on the bridge but this wasn’t a problem as it was very quiet. There was a short walk to the viewing platform which gave views of the gorge from a different angle. However, we had 2 dogs with us and the walkway on to the viewing platform was totally unsuitable. It was made of steel with big holes in it so dogs paws would just fall through. We took in turn seeing the view and the dogs stayed away. We then went for a walk over the other side. We’d been going for about 10 mins when we came across the same type of walkway again and this time there was no alternative or way around. We were so disappointed. This could have been a great dog friendly walk but sadly this let it down totally and given the number of people walking their dogs it must have impacted them as well.","August 2020","Corrieshalloch Gorge","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g316004-d519833-Reviews-Corrieshalloch_Gorge-Ullapool_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html","Ullapool, United Kingdom","attractions","3.0","4.5"
"Stunning walk","Only a small car park (free) so I’d suggest getting there early. Superb circular walk with a clearly defined route. The walk up to the actual caves is not for the faint hearted though as the path is basically a ledge with a very steep slope on one side. It was particularly windy when we were there so it was a bit hairy ! The scenery is spectacular and the caves really interesting. We took the dogs and they were off lead all the way apart from the climb up to the caves and down. Perfect for a couple of hours.","August 2020","The Bone Caves","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g316004-d3224277-Reviews-The_Bone_Caves-Ullapool_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html","Ullapool, United Kingdom","attractions","5.0","4.5"

We chose not to have the set menu but the meal that we chose was beautiful. Starters came promptly but then we had to wait for over 45 minutes for our main course. Whilst this wasn’t a problem for us it could be for some. The live music was great and not overly loud. The serving staff were pleasant and helpful despite the restaurant being extremely busy. Overall a really pleasant experience and one that I will repeat in the future.","February 2020","The Botanist","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190764-d19460462-Reviews-The_Botanist-Warrington_Cheshire_England.html","Warrington, United Kingdom","restaurants","4.0","4.0"

"Well worth a visit!","We decided to walk to Perlan from the city centre and it took us about 20 minutes so not too far. When we got there I felt as if there wouldn't be too much to do as it looked quite small but I was pleasantly surprised. The Arora show was amazing and we actually watched it twice. It only lasted about 20 minutes and wasn't busy at all. All the other exhibitions were extremely well done and I learnt so much about Iceland and its history. Great interactive exhibits as well. The coffee shop and viewing level were amazing with fantastic views over all the city.

"Gem of a fins","We visited for dinner when staying at our friend’s house. This is a beautiful pub/restaurant. Our table wasn’t ready when we arrived but no worries as there was a great bar with a huge selection to wait in. Our meal could not be faulted. Everything was super fresh and beautifully presented. The service was second to none. The only reason that I did not give 5 stars was the size of the portion for our main course. Three of us had lemon sole (which was divine) but came with no vegetables other than potatoes. As the portion was already small and at £19.95 I think that this was a let down. Surely some extra vegetables would not have cost much to the kitchen cost? I would certainly return though as the menu was amazing!","October 2019","The Farmers Arms","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1639847-d4702725-Reviews-The_Farmers_Arms-Great_Eccleston_Lancashire_England.html","Great Eccleston, United Kingdom","restaurants","4.0","4.5"
"Hugely informative","One of the things I struggle with when travelling round ancient monuments is the amount of information that you have to read on plinths around the site. Struggling to read them in baking heat and jostling for a good spot to see the writing. Not so at the Panathenaic Stadium. Audio guides were provided within the entrance fee. This was one of my favourite places. There is an amazing atmosphere as you are walking round making you feel as if you’ve stepped back in time. Climbing to the top of the stadium was no mean feat but take it slowly and then enjoy the amazing view from the top.

"Dark Cave closed for renovation","We didn’t realise the Dark Cave was closed for renovation when we got there which was disappointing but there was plenty to see otherwise. Note for ladies that unless you have trousers or a maxi dress on you have to hire a scarf to tie round your waist for 2 ringitts. The caves themselves were pretty uninspiring and most people seemed to be concentrating on staying clear of the monkeys who were very persistent and not to be argued with. The climb up was via steep steps and you need to be pretty fit to do this especially in the heat.

"A Hidden Gem","I visited CJ’s for the first time today and it certainly won’t be my last. The atmosphere was so welcoming and you instantly felt at ease. The scones with jam and clotted cream were second to none! I shall certainly be recommending CJ’s to all my friends. Looking forward to a return visit!","August 2019","CJ'S Coffee House & Tearoom","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190764-d13698303-Reviews-CJ_S_Coffee_House_Tearoom-Warrington_Cheshire_England.html","Warrington, United Kingdom","restaurants","5.0","5.0"
"Why the tunnel?","Really didn't understand why the first part of this experience was set in a tunnel. Trying to read the information by the light of a small lamp was quite honestly ridiculous! It would have been much more interesting if it had just been a normal sort of museum and I would have been much more willing to linger to read everything. Instead I just wanted to get out! Then we were put through various poses in front of murals on the walls and this went on for over an hour! It was tedious and what started out as being a bit of fun ended with all five of us desperate to get out! Not to be repeated!!","July 2019","Penang Time Tunnel","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298303-d5987608-Reviews-Penang_Time_Tunnel-George_Town_Penang_Island_Penang.html","Penang Island, Malaysia","attractions","2.0","4.0"
"Great experience!","Having seen this as a highlighted restaurant in the Lonely Planet guide book, we were keen to try it out. So glad that we did! It was slightly confusing initially as there just seemed to be a huge crowd of people milling round with no obvious queue. However, the key was to catch the eye of the lady with the clipboard and let her know how many were in your party and she would give you a playing card! Having done this you just sat (if you could get a seat!) and waited until she pointed at you to let you know the table was ready. I don't think that you could go wrong here with any of the choice of dishes, but we ordered a variety of things including the double roasted pork with chilli padi. It was amazing and so cheap. Be prepared to wait for your table but you won't be disappointed.","July 2019","Tek Sen Restaurant","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298303-d1899837-Reviews-Tek_Sen_Restaurant-George_Town_Penang_Island_Penang.html","Penang Island, Malaysia","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Hidden Gem","We would never have found this fabulous little restaurant had we not had the Lonely Planet Guide Book. What a great find! There were five of us and most of us had the duck and it was amazing! My youngest daughter wasn't a fan of duck but there was plenty on the menu to satisfy her as well. The desserts were not to be missed either. This restaurant was as good as any high end place and at a fraction of the price","July 2019","What the Duck Restaurant Penang","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298303-d7341028-Reviews-What_the_Duck_Restaurant_Penang-George_Town_Penang_Island_Penang.html","Penang Island, Malaysia","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Worth a visit!","Very hot and smelly when we were there but well worth a visit! We were bombarded by free samples of durian ice-cream though.

"Beat the queues!","We'd heard that queues for the funicular could be horrendous at the weekends so we chose a Monday for our visit and it was around 12pm. We waited less than 10 minutes in the queue at the bottom so did not need to pay extra for the fast pass. The views from the top were spectacular although I struggled with some of the tacky gift shops at the top. We had to wait a little longer to come down about 2 hours later probably about 30 minutes or so. Well worth a visit but time it well!","July 2019","Penang Hill","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298303-d455283-Reviews-Penang_Hill-George_Town_Penang_Island_Penang.html","Penang Island, Malaysia","attractions","5.0","4.0"

"Great location!","We booked two rooms in this hotel, a suite and a double room both on club level. I really couldn't fault the facilities. The club level staff were exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were beautiful and very modern. The location of the hotel was perfect and we could walk easily to our destination. I would highly recommend this hotel and club level in particular.","July 2019","JEN Penang Georgetown by Shangri-La","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298303-d302162-Reviews-JEN_Penang_Georgetown_by_Shangri_La-George_Town_Penang_Island_Penang.html","Penang Island, Malaysia","hotels","5.0","4.0"
"Highlight of our trip!","We went on a river night time cruise. Amazing! We saw Irrawaddy dolphins, different types of monkey and when it had gone dark, fireflies that were truly magical!

"Stunning!","We were lucky enough to meet a 'grab' driver who totally organised this trip for us! We were picked up directly from our hotel and he'd arranged a personal guide to take us round the park. It was extremely hot and humid but our guide was fab and took us on a walk that was challenging but manageable. We saw lots of wildlife that i think we would have missed had we not had the guide. The actual trails were not very well signed in my opinion and I think that there would have been a good chance we would have got lost if we were on our own. At the end of the day we had an extra boat ride that took us all along the coast line, seeing dolphins along the way.","July 2019","Bako National Park","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298309-d10810369-Reviews-Bako_National_Park-Kuching_Sarawak.html","Kuching, Malaysia","attractions","5.0","4.5"
"Great for families!","We stayed here as a family of 5, all of us adults. We were lucky enough to be given interconnecting rooms which was a real bonus. We had a suite and a double room. We were staying club level and the staff were very attentive. The hotel is perfectly placed in Kuching right on the waterfront and the views were spectacular. The club level was great for convenience but I felt it lacked atmosphere and the choice of food was somewhat limited. On the odd occasion that we ordered eggs it seemed to take an age to arrive. Overall the hotel is a little tired in places, especially the bathrooms, but I couldn't fault the service.","July 2019","Hilton Kuching","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298309-d300609-Reviews-Hilton_Kuching-Kuching_Sarawak.html","Kuching, Malaysia","hotels","4.0","4.0"
"Stunning!","We loved Gardens by the Bay. We were staying at Marina Bay Sands and had a birds eye view of the night time light show. We did pay to go into the domes and they were amazing! We were lucky enough to be walking on the Skywalk when one of the light shows were on which was really special. Just a warning that if you have bought your tickets for the domes on line and they include the skywalk, you still have to go to the ticket office to get a time to go up. We didn't and had to argue our case for this. Luckily we got to go up","July 2019","Gardens by the Bay","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d2149128-Reviews-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html","Singapore, Singapore","attractions","5.0","4.5"
