Antihydrogen, made entirely of antiparticles, is believed to be stable, and it is this longevity that holds the promise of precision studies of matter&#8211;antimatter symmetry. We have recently demonstrated trapping of antihydrogen atoms by releasing them after a confinement time of 172&#8201;ms. A critical question for future studies is: how long can anti-atoms be trapped? Here, we report the observation of anti-atom confinement for 1,000&#8201;s, extending our earlier results by nearly four orders of magnitude. Our calculations indicate that most of the trapped anti-atoms reach the ground state. Further, we report the first measurement of the energy distribution of trapped antihydrogen, which, coupled with detailed comparisons with simulations, provides a key tool for the systematic investigation of trapping dynamics. These advances open up a range of experimental possibilities, including precision studies of charge&#8211;parity&#8211;time reversal symmetry and cooling to temperatures where gravitational effects could become apparent.</p>","粒子和反粒子构成的原子是不稳定的，通常存活不到一微秒。完全由反粒子构成的抗氢被认为是稳定的，正是这种长寿才使人们有可能对物质的抗物质对称性进行精确的研究。我们最近证明了在172 ms的限制时间后释放氢原子，从而捕获了氢原子。未来研究的一个关键问题是：抗原子能被捕获多长时间？在这里，我们报告了对抗原子约束作用1,000 s的观察，将我们先前的结果扩展了将近四个数量级。我们的计算表明，大多数被捕获的反原子达到了基态。此外，我们报告了捕获的氢的能量分布的首次测量结果，再加上与模拟的详细比较，为系统研究捕获动力学提供了关键工具。这些进展开辟了一系列实验可能性，包括对电荷奇偶性和时间反转对称性的精确研究以及冷却至引力作用可能变得明显的温度。</ p> "
"10.1038/nphys1994","Noise spectroscopy through dynamical decoupling with a superconducting flux qubit","通过动态解耦与超导通量量子位的噪声光谱 ","<p>Quantum coherence in natural and artificial spin systems is fundamental to applications ranging from quantum information science to magnetic-resonance imaging and identification. Several multipulse control sequences targeting generalized noise models have been developed to extend coherence by dynamically decoupling a spin system from its noisy environment. In any particular implementation, however, the efficacy of these methods is sensitive to the specific frequency distribution of the noise, suggesting that these same pulse sequences could also be used to probe the noise spectrum directly. Here we demonstrate noise spectroscopy by means of dynamical decoupling using a superconducting qubit with energy-relaxation time T<sub>1</sub>=12&#8201;&#956;s. We first demonstrate that dynamical decoupling improves the coherence time T<sub>2</sub> in this system up to the T<sub>2</sub>=2&#8201;T<sub>1</sub> limit (pure dephasing times exceeding 100&#8201;&#956;s), and then leverage its filtering properties to probe the environmental noise over a frequency (f) range 0.2&#8211;20&#8201;MHz, observing a 1/f<sup>&#945;</sup> distribution with &#945;&lt;1.

With the advent of prepolarization methods and detection schemes using atomic magnetometers or superconducting quantum interference devices, interest in NMR in fields comparable to the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and below (down to zero field) has been revived. Despite the use of superconducting quantum interference devices or atomic magnetometers, low-field NMR typically suffers from low sensitivity compared with conventional high-field NMR. Here we demonstrate direct detection of zero-field NMR signals generated through parahydrogen-induced polarization, enabling high-resolution NMR without the use of any magnets. The sensitivity is sufficient to observe spectra exhibiting <sup>13</sup>C&#8211;<sup>1</sup>H scalar nuclear spin&#8211;spin couplings (known as J&#160;couplings) in compounds with <sup>13</sup>C in natural abundance, without the need for signal averaging.

These patterns however are often dominated by specific locations and recurrent flows and poorly modelled by the random diffusive dynamics generally used to study them. Here we develop a theoretical framework to analyse contagion within a network of locations where individuals recall their geographic origins. We find a phase transition between a regime in which the contagion affects a large fraction of the system and one in which only a small fraction is affected. This transition cannot be uncovered by continuous deterministic models because of the stochastic features of the contagion process and defines an invasion threshold that depends on mobility parameters, providing guidance for controlling contagion spread by constraining mobility processes. We recover the threshold behaviour by analysing diffusion processes mediated by real human commuting data.</p>","<p>人类的活动和活动方式在许多层面上介导了传染，包括传染病的空间传播，谣言的传播和共识的出现。但是，这些模式通常受特定位置和经常性流量的支配，而通常用于研究它们的随机扩散动力学的模型则较差。在这里，我们建立了一个理论框架来分析个人回忆其地理起源的地点网络中的传染病。我们发现，在一种传染会影响系统大部分的机制与一种只影响一小部分机制的机制之间存在一个相变。由于传染过程的随机性，无法用连续的确定性模型揭示这种转变，并且定义了取决于移动性参数的入侵阈值，为通过限制移动性过程控制传染扩散提供了指导。我们通过分析真实人类通勤数据介导的扩散过程来恢复阈值行为。</ p> "
