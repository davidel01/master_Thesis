"Disappointing to say the least","Our company came to Athens for our team building. Everything was perfect until our last night, and our official dinner, which was scheduled at this restaurant. The difficulties in arrangements with them started even before we came to Greece because a few days prior to our arrival they started changing parts of our agreements and finally asking for an advance payment. We have respected every demand on their behalf, hoping to facilitate things and make everything easier for us and them when we actually come then for dinner. To our surprise, when we arrived there, they seated us on the second floor and not on the roof top, with some lame excuse that they never place groups on the roof top. Nothing of that was ever said to us. The service was good, while serving food, after that we had to wait for drinks for the longest time. After some time they even started ignoring us, trying not to serve us, even though we chose the unlimited drinks menu.
Horrible, horrible service. Nice food and wine.","October 2019","C Restaurant - Athens Rooftop Restaurant","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14455968-Reviews-C_Restaurant_Athens_Rooftop_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","restaurants","1.0","4.5"
"Very, very lively","Monastiraki is a great place for us who like small shops, local spirit and shopping. Apart from shopping, this is a great place to have something to eat, a great historical site where you can learn so many things about ancient Greece, it's history and mythology.","October 2019","Monastiraki","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d265865-Reviews-Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","attractions","5.0","4.0"
