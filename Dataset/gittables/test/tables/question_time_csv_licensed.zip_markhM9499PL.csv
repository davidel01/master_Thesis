"Highly recomended.","The place is only two minutes off the main street to Acropolis and Museum i would recommend you do find it is next to a small supermarket.
When we walked in was meet by the owner / chef , his passion came over about the way he cooked and freshness of the food. The menu is not vast witch makes it easy for your choice, it as a good wine list in stock. From your order you can watch it being cooked as there just a small glass divider, witch makes it nice see it all as the ower say it fresh. We had a couple main course and pudding, drinks and i found it good value.","February 2020","Belpaese","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3323606-Reviews-Belpaese-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","restaurants","5.0","4.5"

After booking a Deluxe Double room , went to room and it was over looking the pool room 368, from the the website picture it showed it was views looking out to the city.
I did go to ask at reception and the nice concierge said i could have a room over looking the main road but is nosey with trafic.
The rooms have that nice warm and lush feel and veary large bed, as well veary comfortable to sleep on.
The breckfast is served on top floor 7 and as the stunning views of athens land mark's food is fresh and a good selection from any country you come from, staff are extremely polite and friendly.
Did look at the evening menu but for me i feel for a three courses and couple drinks it would be around 150 euros per head, i feel it was bit high even tho nice views. But haveing beautiful meal out side the hotel five minutes away for just 30 euros a head.
The views can be seen in the day buy walking round the city.
My only one disappointment, unknown to me my wife had booked a serprize in the room on arrival as it was my 60th, but it was not there and never arrive at any time off the stay. If i knew this i would have Inquired but was only told when we had got home.

The menu is good and you find that you not disappointed on any off the items on offer, and plenty full.
I did the takeaway couple time, and have to say one off best pizza to go.
One thing you have to consider as it all cooked to order, so it can take little time, but have say you not be disappointed at all.

"Over Priced","First time at The Flying Pig, The place as a welcoming atmosphere, we booked a table for a meal.
First thing which i add not realised it allowed dogs and in the eating area as well, the time we were there, i noticed that on three tables in the eating area were six dogs.
The food was normal pub grub, it was tasty, but the amounts you get were not justified by the prices. I myself had ribeye which was only 6 inch in diameter, one tomato cut in half three onion rings and a small basket of frys, small jar of jus , witch was priced £23.95.
I would expect with the amount being served, around the £15 mark .
When we asked for the bill, we showed them our local discount card, so then having the discount deducted, we had a £50. Gift voucher.
When coming to pay, they first did not take the discount voucher off so had to redo the bill again. This time they did not give us the local discount so it finshed up paying full price.
They put pressure on trying to resolve this and we finshed up having to leave.
My over view would be if your looking for a bar meal, and happy paying over the odds and ok with dogs sat round you as eat then The flying Pig ok.","May 2019","The Flying Pig","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190820-d9589904-Reviews-The_Flying_Pig-Bowness_on_Windermere_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html","Bowness-on-Windermere, United Kingdom","restaurants","3.0","4.0"

The place was not busy so was nice to be able to chat.
It was a shame there was no Christmas music played at all why we were there.i would say as a over all i felt it was just like a normal pub meal and Christmas atmosphere was not there.the meal total came to £120 for three.","December 2018","The Waterside Inn","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g4414821-d3858789-Reviews-The_Waterside_Inn-Leigh_Greater_Manchester_England.html","Leigh, United Kingdom","restaurants","4.0","3.5"

If you know about Guinness it nice to see the Setling of the pint not flat with no life.
From having the main meal, sweet and one coffee was ordered and with my surprise and half hour wait, then they for got coffee and when that landed we all finshed, the sweet.

"Excellent Place To Stay","From the warm welcome from the staff booking in is easy, we stayed in Deluxe Double room, on the second floor facing the front of Hotel.
There plenty of room very large bed. There is tea and coffee provide with a well stock fridge and snacks. The TV as got full European service.
The room was cleaned daily and new linen. The breakfast, is freshly made and a good overall selection, from hot to cold, you may find the plates small but you can always go get more so not to over indulge.
Couple off points to remember if booking a room if you are looking to book the front of the Hotel, the tram system goes pass the front of Hotel and it is nosey and you can feel the vibration when they pass, it runs from 5 am to 12 pm daily. So I would suggest trying for third floor up. the over point even though the baths room are stunning, it can be difficult as the bath side is quit high.","April 2017","Art Deco Imperial Hotel","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d280821-Reviews-Art_Deco_Imperial_Hotel-Prague_Bohemia.html","Prague, Czech Republic","hotels","5.0","4.5"

There are good coffee bars and restaurants.
Points to note,
There is a DVD player in the room but you must bring your own DVDs as there none DVD library.
Hotel reception cold be bit more help full on arrival with the hotel amenities.
There is no information book in the rooms about things to do and amenities of the Hotel.
The Hotel it self could do with a fleshing up as the carpets in places have seen some wear and tear, Even though it clean.

"Traditional greek food.","The place is warming and friendly and plenty of room to enjoy your meal, nice open fire in winter.
The is fresh home cooked food by the chef who as been working there for 18 yr.
One thing I would say in Volos they do tsipouro { tipalo } were you pay for a shot and get a free tapa style starter you find this in most restaurant, so if you going to have a starter with meal ask about tsipouro first more fun. With ice and a tot of water.","January 2017","Veggera Restaurant","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189507-d5029513-Reviews-Veggera_Restaurant-Volos_Magnesia_Region_Thessaly.html","Volos, Greece","restaurants","5.0","4.5"

Note I did not eat the meal and was taken away, then when it came to paying for the evening they charged for the meal I sent back.
As for the service we was not looked after.
I never had a pasta made with only tin tomatoes and tin tuna.
