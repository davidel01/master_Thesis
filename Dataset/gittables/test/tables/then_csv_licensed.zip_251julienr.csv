"Fantastic haven of peace within the city","Beautiful environment, with flourishing plants and fruits everywhere, nice live music, delicious dishes, well presented and great service with a waiter that took pleasure to explain what was on the menu.
Can't recommend it enough!","September 2020","Pelican Kipos Cafe Wine Restaurant","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d1717909-Reviews-Pelican_Kipos_Cafe_Wine_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html","Santorini, Greece","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Nice place","Very nice restaurant, affordable, large portions and great staff.
On top, it is just 2 minutes from the sea, making it the perfect choice to have a nice walk by the water after dinner.","September 2020","To Apomero","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g667488-d10080031-Reviews-To_Apomero-Ornos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html","Mykonos, Greece","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Such a fantastic place","Lost in the middle of nowhere, far from the buzzing of the city, lies a secret place where the time has stopped.
The food is great and traditional, the staff is nice, but this isn't why you should go there. You should go there because it feels like a painting, a quiet and beautiful place you'll love to spend some time.","September 2020","rízes","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2296448-d18980847-Reviews-Rizes-Ano_Mera_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html","Mykonos, Greece","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Fantastic location and great host","First of all, the location is fantastic. 15 mins walk from all worth to see places and restaurants. We didn't take taxi, bus or métro à single time.
Second, the place is just nice. We'll designed with taste, spacious... It just feels like home.
Third, from the large terrace you got both a good view of the Acropolis AND a fantastic sunset every night.
Last, the host thought of everything : nice tips, laundry detergent, coffee, tea, cookies, water in the fridge...
Such a GREAT place to stay in Athens!","September 2020","Central Athens Loft","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15690137-Reviews-Central_Athens_Loft-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","hotels","5.0","5.0"
"Local canteen","This really feels like a school canteen.
The food is OK, neither good nor bad, presented as if someone with a large laddle threw it in your plate.
The staff doesn't know how to smile. Warmth isn't their strength.
You need to know crappy bread is automatically given to you, and you'll need to pay for it, whether you eat it or not.
Unless you're on a tight budget and want to avoid fast foods, you can find something better.","September 2020","Niko's Taverna","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d1507969-Reviews-Niko_s_Taverna-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html","Mykonos, Greece","restaurants","3.0","3.5"
"Great view, crappy staff","This is the place you can't miss. It is magical, really.. But even with that, the staff sucks. They are not polite, not helpful, can even be rude.
We've asked ""where would be the best place to see a great sunset?"" The answer? ""How would I know?! Whichever you want!""
On top of that, the place was supposed to close at 8pm, but they kicked everyone out at 6.55, making us miss the end of the sunset.
Great place, terrible staff.","September 2020","Acropolis","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","attractions","3.0","4.5"
"Absolutely perfect!","First, the staff is lovely.
Second, the food is both well presented and delicious.
Third, the price is surprisingly low. We thought there was a trick, they would charge the water (bottle) or even the alcohol hand-gel. They did not.
Fourth, they brought us a surprise free drink and, since my wife couldn't have alcohol, took it back to the kitchen then returned with an ice cream. Free! And we just had two dishes, not a full meal with wine!
That IS great customer service.
This is THE place to visit when you're in town!!!","September 2020","Thes ""Greek Creative Cuisine""","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d17837015-Reviews-Thes_Greek_Creative_Cuisine-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","restaurants","5.0","5.0"
"Kicked out with no apology","We came with my wife after dinner for a nice dessert before returning to the hotel.
There were maybe 5 or 6 empty tables outdoor.
We sit, order two desserts. The waiter confirms the order, then leaves.
Two minutes later, he and his manager come back, accompanied by two other customers : ""We do not serve only dessert here"", pointing at the exit. We barely got up that he was already inviting the other two customers to sit in our stand.
So poor service level.","June 2018","La Cantina dei Mille","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d3194050-Reviews-La_Cantina_dei_Mille-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html","Naples, Italy","restaurants","1.0","4.0"
