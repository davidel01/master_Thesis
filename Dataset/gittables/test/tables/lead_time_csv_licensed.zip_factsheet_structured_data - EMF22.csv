"","guiding questions","preamble","","","The EMF 22 International Scenarios engaged ten of the world's leading integrated assessment models to focus on the combined implications of three factors integral to international climate negotiations, (1) the long-term climate-related target, expressed in this study in terms of the CO2-equivalent concentration associated with the GHGs regulated under the Kyoto Protocol, (2) whether or not this target can be temporarily exceeded prior to 2100 
(“overshoot”) allowing for greater near-term flexibility, and (3) the nature of international participation in emissions mitigation."
"","","question","","1.0","What are the feasibility and implications of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at 650, 550 or 450 ppm CO2eq?"
"","","question","","2.0","What are the implications of allowing a temporary exceedence of greenhouse gas concentrations 2100 (“overshoot”) vs. implementing concentration targets as ceilings over the entire century (""not-to-exceed"")?"
"","","question","","3.0","What are the implications of comprehensive international collaboration vs. fragmented climate policy efforts  towards the climate targets?"
"","","question","","4.0","individual models explored the importance of economic growth and the availability of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)"
"","","question","","5.0","low vs. high technology development for achieving different climate targets"
"","results","preamble","","","The challenge of mitigation increases with the stringency of the target. The more ambitious target (450 ppm CO2e, consistent with the 2°C-limit) is particularly challenging."
"","","insight","","1.0","The achvievabiltiy and costs of achieving climate targets depends critically on target stringency and the degree of internationl collaboration. A failure to develop a comprehensive, international approach to climate mitigation will constrain efforts to meet ambitious climate related targets. Without early, comprehensive action by major emitting regions, concentrations may exceed particularly ambitious targets such as 450 ppmv CO2-e and even 550 ppmv CO2-e."
"","","insight","","2.0","Regardless of the target, the global costs of achieving any long-term climate-related target will be higher without comprehensive action, and may be higher not just for the initial entrants but also for those that join along the way. "
"","","insight","","3.0","The ability to temporarily exceed, or overshoot, long-term goals may make some of the more stringent long-term climate limitation goals more achievable and lessen the impacts of a failure to achieve comprehensive action, but these pathways come at a cost. Overshoot pathways will lead to greater climate impacts than pathways that keep concentrations below their long-term goal at all times."
