A two-year standstill agreement would require the activists to vote in favor of all board proposals till 2021.","While Caligan and Falcon were open to settling for one seat instead of two, the stand-still demand, described as ""off-market"" in the funds' letter here dated March 29, was a dealbreaker, the source said.","Caligan and Falcon Edge also posted a presentation (bit.ly/2YNXqka) on Wednesday, demanding the company release detailed financials for its struggling Intelligent Audio segment.","The funds said they believe Knowles’ stock could reach at least $28 per share in value by the end of the year if the company listened to their feedback.","JPMorgan, Caligan Partners, Falcon Edge and Knowles Corp declined to comment.","(This story corrects headline to remove reference to legal counsel.)",""
