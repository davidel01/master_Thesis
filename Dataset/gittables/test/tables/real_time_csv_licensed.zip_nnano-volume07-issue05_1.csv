Such matter&#8211;wave interference has been observed for electrons, neutrons, atoms and molecules and, in contrast to classical physics, quantum interference can be observed when single particles arrive at the detector one by one. The build-up of such patterns in experiments with electrons has been described as the &#8220;most beautiful experiment in physics&#8221;. Here, we show how a combination of nanofabrication and nano-imaging allows us to record the full two-dimensional build-up of quantum interference patterns in real time for phthalocyanine molecules and for derivatives of phthalocyanine molecules, which have masses of 514&#160;AMU and 1,298&#160;AMU respectively. A laser-controlled micro-evaporation source was used to produce a beam of molecules with the required intensity and coherence, and the gratings were machined in 10-nm-thick silicon nitride membranes to reduce the effect of van der Waals forces. Wide-field fluorescence microscopy detected the position of each molecule with an accuracy of 10&#160;nm and revealed the build-up of a deterministic ensemble interference pattern from single molecules that arrived stochastically at the detector.

Such control has been demonstrated in various mesoscopic devices at cryogenic temperatures, but it has proved to be difficult to exert control over the wavefunction at higher temperatures. Molecules have typical energy level spacings (&#8764;eV) that are much larger than the thermal energy at 300 K (&#8764;25 meV), and are therefore natural candidates for such experiments. Previously, phenomena such as giant magnetoresistance, Kondo effects and conductance switching have been observed in single molecules, and theorists have predicted that it should also be possible to observe quantum interference in molecular conductors, but until now all the evidence for such behaviour has been indirect. Here, we report the observation of destructive quantum interference in charge transport through two-terminal molecular junctions at room temperature.

Here, we show that anodes consisting of an active silicon nanotube surrounded by an ion-permeable silicon oxide shell can cycle over 6,000 times in half cells while retaining more than 85% of their initial capacity. The outer surface of the silicon nanotube is prevented from expansion by the oxide shell, and the expanding inner surface is not exposed to the electrolyte, resulting in a stable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase.

The prevailing model of Joule heating relies on a simple semiclassical picture in which electrons collide with the atoms of a conductor, generating heat locally and only in regions of non-zero current density, and this model has been supported by most experiments. Recently, however, it has been predicted that electric currents in graphene and carbon nanotubes can couple to the vibrational modes of a neighbouring material, heating it remotely. Here, we use in situ electron thermal microscopy to detect the remote Joule heating of a silicon nitride substrate by a single multiwalled carbon nanotube. At least 84% of the electrical power supplied to the nanotube is dissipated directly into the substrate, rather than in the nanotube itself. Although it has different physical origins, this phenomenon is reminiscent of induction heating or microwave dielectric heating.

These applications rely on the ability to position a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within a few nanometres of a sample, and then scan it across the sample surface, while preserving the centre's spin coherence and readout fidelity. However, existing scanning techniques, which use a single diamond nanocrystal grafted onto the tip of a scanning probe microscope, suffer from short spin coherence times due to poor crystal quality, and from inefficient far-field collection of the fluorescence from the nitrogen-vacancy centre. Here, we demonstrate a robust method for scanning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within tens of nanometres from a sample surface that addresses both of these concerns. This is achieved by positioning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre at the end of a high-purity diamond nanopillar, which we use as the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our approach ensures long nitrogen-vacancy spin coherence times (&#8764;75 &#181;s), enhanced nitrogen-vacancy collection efficiencies due to waveguiding, and mechanical robustness of the device (several weeks of scanning time).

"10.1038/nnano.2012.52","An atlas of carbon nanotube optical transitions","碳纳米管光学跃迁图集 ","<p>Electron&#8211;electron interactions are significantly enhanced in one-dimensional systems, and single-walled carbon nanotubes provide a unique opportunity for studying such interactions and the related many-body effects in one dimension. However, single-walled nanotubes can have a wide range of diameters and hundreds of different structures, each defined by its chiral index (n,m), where n and m are integers that can have values from zero up to 30 or more. Moreover, one-third of these structures are metals and two-thirds are semiconductors, and they display optical resonances at many different frequencies. Systematic studies of many-body effects in nanotubes would therefore benefit from the availability of a technique for identifying the chiral index of a nanotube based on a measurement of its optical resonances, and vice versa. Here, we report the establishment of a structure&#8211;property &#8216;atlas&#8217; for nanotube optical transitions based on simultaneous electron diffraction measurements of the chiral index and Rayleigh scattering measurements of the optical resonances of 206 different single-walled nanotube structures. The nanotubes, which were suspended across open slit structures on silicon substrates, had diameters in the range 1.3&#8211;4.7&#160;nm. We also use this atlas as a starting point for a systematic study of many-body effects in the excited states of single-walled nanotubes. We find that electron&#8211;electron interactions shift the optical resonance energies by the same amount for both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, and that this shift (which corresponds to an effective Fermi velocity renormalization) increases monotonically with nanotube diameter. This behaviour arises from two sources: an intriguing cancellation of long-range electron&#8211;electron interaction effects, and the dependence of short-range electron&#8211;electron interactions on diameter.</p>","<p>电子与电子的相互作用在一维系统中得到了显着增强，单壁碳纳米管为研究此类相互作用以及一维相关的多体效应提供了独特的机会。然而，单壁纳米管可以具有宽范围的直径和数百种不同的结构，每种结构均由其手性指数（n，m）定义，其中n和m是整数，其值可以为零到30或更大。此外，这些结构的三分之一是金属，三分之二是半导体，它们在许多不同的频率下显示出光学共振。因此，纳米管中多体效应的系统研究将受益于基于纳米管的光共振测量来鉴定纳米管的手性指数的技术，反之亦然。在这里，我们报告了一个结构体属性地图集的建立。基于同时手性指数的电子衍射测量和206种不同单壁纳米管结构的光学共振的瑞利散射测量，对纳米管进行了光跃迁。悬浮在硅衬底上的开口狭缝结构上的纳米管的直径在1.3到4.7 nm的范围内。我们还将这个图集用作系统研究单壁纳米管激发态中多体效应的起点。我们发现，电子和电子相互作用使金属和半导体纳米管的光学共振能量偏移相同的量，并且该偏移（对应于有效的费米速度重新归一化）随纳米管直径单调增加。这种现象的产生有两个原因：一个有趣的是消除了长程电子的相互作用，以及短程电子对直径的依赖性。</ p> "

Here, we demonstrate transparent photonic devices based on graphene/insulator stacks, which are formed by depositing alternating wafer-scale graphene sheets and thin insulating layers, then patterning them together into photonic-crystal-like structures. We show experimentally that the plasmon in such stacks is unambiguously non-classical. Compared with doping in single-layer graphene, distributing carriers into multiple graphene layers effectively enhances the plasmonic resonance frequency and magnitude, which is different from the effect in a conventional semiconductor superlattice and is a direct consequence of the unique carrier density scaling law of the plasmonic resonance of Dirac fermions.
