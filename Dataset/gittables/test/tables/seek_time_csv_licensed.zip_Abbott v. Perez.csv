"Scott A. Keller","Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Texas legislature did not have a racially discriminatory purpose when it adopted the entire court-ordered congressional remedial plan and virtually all of the remedial state house plan. This Court told the district court to order districts that do not violate the Constitution or the VRA, and on remand in 2012, the district court itself said it obeyed this Court's remand and it fixed all plausible legal defects under even the low Section 5 standard. And, indeed, today, with nine groups of plaintiffs here, we cannot draw a single additional performing majority/minority district, even though plaintiffs have tried for years under both plans."
"Sonia Sotomayor","General Keller, I know you want to get to the merits, but I don't want to leave the jurisdiction question."
"Scott A. Keller","Sure."
"Sonia Sotomayor","Well, it did at least in one of the challenges, when there were --"
"Scott A. Keller","Not -- not a performing district."
"Sonia Sotomayor","I think that's subject to dispute by your adversary, so let -- let's -- but the point still remains, which is every time you're ordered to change one district, it affects other districts. And in the end, the court, in drawing maps, may find that something it concluded initially is proven wrong by the map drawing. So that goes to why finality requires us to often wait for a remedy --"
"Scott A. Keller","Well --"
"Sonia Sotomayor","-- before we permit appeal."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, first of all, in Gunn, what the district court did is it expressly stayed its own ruling, and then for months later, it issued no further order. Here, in quite stark contrast, a mere 21 and 13 days after the district court entered its order, it was ordering the state to appear for expedited court-drawn redistricting."
"Sonia Sotomayor","No."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, not in orderly appellate review."
"Stephen G. Breyer","Yeah."
"Scott A. Keller","And, moreover, here --"
"Stephen G. Breyer","Yeah."
"Scott A. Keller","-- what distinguishes this case from virtually all other cases that the Court has had is we were ordered to do expedited redistricting on the eve of election deadlines."
"Stephen G. Breyer","You weren't ordered. I mean, that's the problem."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, there is no magic word ""injunction"" used in these orders, but under Carson --"
"Stephen G. Breyer","I didn't say magic word."
"Scott A. Keller","Sure."
"Stephen G. Breyer","That's it."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, because the practical effect of that order here was blocking us from using the maps in the 2018 elections."
"Elena Kagan","Well, General, I think that that might well be true, but I think it's -- it's also true in pretty much all of these districting cases."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, first of all, as an initial matter, many of these cases would come to the court in a preliminary injunction posture."
"Sonia Sotomayor","Well, that's quite -- that's quite odd."
"Scott A. Keller","No."
"Sonia Sotomayor","You still -- well, it hasn't happened, but you could have had a -- an appeal from that."
"Scott A. Keller","That's what --"
"Sonia Sotomayor","My point goes back to --"
"Scott A. Keller","We are taking an appeal from that today."
"Sonia Sotomayor","What you're now saying to us is we have an appeal after the preliminary injunction."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, but we were in the same posture as Cooper and Gill and there were not remedial maps there."
"Sonia Sotomayor","That's in 1291. I'm talking about 1253."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, but that would have been Cooper and Gill."
"Sonia Sotomayor","But that goes back to Justice Breyer's question."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, but unlike in Gunn, for instance, here -- in Gunn, the district court stayed its own order and took no additional action for months."
"Sonia Sotomayor","But we don't know that --"
"Elena Kagan","General, if -- if I could --"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What would have happened if you had told the district court, well, fine, you've issued an opinion, but we're going ahead and we're going to conduct elections under the map that was adopted by the state legislature?"
"Scott A. Keller","We --"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What would have happened?"
"Scott A. Keller","We would have been held in contempt for not obeying this order."
"Elena Kagan","General, if I could -- I'm sorry."
"Scott A. Keller","Not -- no, Justice Kagan. If a court simply says -- declares districts invalid and then issues no other injunction and says the state doesn't have to redistrict, that is a different case."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Counsel --"
"Anthony M. Kennedy","One more question and then you have to get to the merits. Suppose there had been a 45-day window."
"Scott A. Keller","Sure."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","I have a question on the merits. You put a lot of weight on the adoption in 2013 of the court-drawn 20 -- what, 2012, 2011?"
"Scott A. Keller","2012."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","2012 plan. And I -- I think a concern, though, is that the district court plan was not comprehensive."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, for three reasons: First of all, there was plenty of process in the court in 2011 and 2012."
"Sonia Sotomayor","Mr. General --"
"Scott A. Keller","-- by discriminatory purpose."""
"Sonia Sotomayor","General, one of the things in this recitation that you forget is that it wasn't just that court opining on these maps."
"Scott A. Keller","The D.C. court, though, did not find issues with the districts that had been validated."
"Elena Kagan","Well --"
"Scott A. Keller","-- for legislatures engaging in redistricting --"
"Elena Kagan","-- but it --"
"Scott A. Keller","-- to honor both their constitutional and VRA obligations."
"Elena Kagan","It seems as though that that's a -- you're essentially saying that this PI opinion was a safe harbor for the state."
"Scott A. Keller","Justice Kagan, our position is not that somehow this was a categorical safe harbor, that the 2011 legislature's actions could not be examined. But what can't happen is that only 2011 is examined in isolation."
"Elena Kagan","General, what -- what would you think -- let's put aside the court order for a second."
"Scott A. Keller","It is. (Laughter.)"
"Elena Kagan","Suppose there's one map and -- and -- and then there's a second map, and the one map is later found to have all kinds of evidence of discriminatory intent surrounding it."
"Scott A. Keller","Justice Kagan --"
"Elena Kagan","Should it just say there's no e-mails?"
"Scott A. Keller","No, I -- I believe that's a very different case --"
"Elena Kagan","I know it is."
"Scott A. Keller","-- precisely because -- and -- and under Arlington Heights, the court could consider all of that evidence, and in doing that analysis of the sequence of events, the court could take cognizance of the fact that the 2013 legislature there may not have been doing anything at all, and that could possibly go to the purpose. But here, when we have a court-ordered remedial plan and we have wholesale acceptance on the congressional side and virtually wholesale acceptance on the state house side, this was not the legislature trying to pull a fast one on anyone."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I do want to address the merits, but if I could make a -- a few points about jurisdiction at the outset to show why this case is different from other cases that may arise."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I do want to address the merits, but if I could make a -- a few points about jurisdiction at the outset to show why this case is different from other cases that may arise."
"Elena Kagan","Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, that might be true."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","I -- I think the urgency or time limit is -- is -- is a very important consideration, in fact, a very important limitation on what we are proposing here. October 1 was a -- a deadline that the parties and the court in this case accepted, when -- when preliminary measures had to be taken to institute the election."
"Sonia Sotomayor","Mr. Kneedler, what do -- what rule do we set to know how much time is enough time? Meaning, in all of these election cases, it seems to me that every single one of them, even if it's decided today, I'm going to hear that in eight months they have to do something."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Again --"
"Sonia Sotomayor","-- if -- if it's not permitted generally under the law."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","But -- but I think under the practical effect test, one of the practical effects is if the state is facing a deadline in only three days -- if I could use an example which I think this -- brings -- brings this home and would express a federal interest in this."
"Stephen G. Breyer","Yes, but there's a way."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Well, let me make one final important point, and then I do want to move on to -- on to the merits."
"Sonia Sotomayor","Mr. Kneedler --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Mr. Kneedler, you have about five minutes left."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Yes."
"Sonia Sotomayor","So how --"
"Elena Kagan","But, Mr. Kneedler, in -- in your briefs, you acknowledge two things. You acknowledge, first, that when there are two maps and they're exactly the same, that evidence of intent as to the first map is probative of -- of -- of intent as to the second map."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Again, depending on -- depending on the circumstances, but --"
"Elena Kagan","Of course."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Oh, we absolutely agree they are not safe harbors."
"Elena Kagan","So, given that the district court has so much better understanding of the facts than we do, what do you think went wrong here? I'm trying to find the legal principle that went wrong."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","The -- the legal principle that went wrong is the court basically said that the taint that it found in -- with respect to certain districts in 2011 carried forward to 2013."
"Elena Kagan","But I don't think that it did that."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","That's -- that's the way we do -- we do read the opinion."
"Elena Kagan","But -- but -- but here's what they said."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Yes, but -- but if -- if you read that whole section of the district court's opinion, it puts great weight on -- on its perception that the -- the state legislature was required to engage in a -- a deliberative process to make sure it was undoing prior taint. And as we have said, there is no presumption of taint just because a legislature was previously found -- and, by the way, those findings come in --"
"Elena Kagan","Well, that might be right, Mr. Kneedler, that there's no presumption that comes from, but -- but it's -- it's surely evidence that one can take into account that the legislature didn't engage in any kind of deliberative process --"
"Edwin S. Kneedler","But --"
"Elena Kagan","-- after having done a map that's tainted with all kinds of discriminatory intent."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Right."
"Sonia Sotomayor","I'm sorry, I thought the --"
"Edwin S. Kneedler","-- before the -- before the legislature."
"Sonia Sotomayor","-- I thought the legislature had its own attorney tell it that the findings of the district court were tentative, preliminary only, and that what -- and went through what the plaintiffs claim and told them that what they were doing would not address the constitutional issues that were raised by plaintiffs."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Why don't you take an extra couple of minutes."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Okay."
"Sonia Sotomayor","No, I think he said more."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","No, I don't -- I don't -- I don't believe that's what he said."
"Sonia Sotomayor","I -- I -- I --"
"Edwin S. Kneedler","-- on the basis of an independent review that was conducted by an Article III court."
"Sonia Sotomayor","But may I ask something? There's end of litigation."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","I --"
"Sonia Sotomayor","It --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Why don't you answer, Mr. Kneedler."
"Edwin S. Kneedler","Okay. (Laughter.)"
"Edwin S. Kneedler","I -- I -- I don't think that's a fair account of what the -- of what the record shows."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hicks."
"Max Renea Hicks","Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I hadn't anticipated doing this, but I'm going to start with the jurisdictional question, which, of course, is what you all start with. Justice Breyer asked a key question, I think, of -- of -- of the other side in this. He said, show me the language."
"Max Renea Hicks","Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I hadn't anticipated doing this, but I'm going to start with the jurisdictional question, which, of course, is what you all start with. Justice Breyer asked a key question, I think, of -- of -- of the other side in this. He said, show me the language."
"Anthony M. Kennedy","Could -- could Texas have -- have used the current maps for the 2018 elections?"
"Max Renea Hicks","Yes, in the absence -- unfortunately, as far as we're concerned, but yes, in the absence of --"
"Anthony M. Kennedy","I mean insofar as the court's order was concerned."
"Max Renea Hicks","Yes."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, but the judge -- the court gave the -- the governor three days --"
"Stephen G. Breyer","Three days."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","-- to call an election."
"Max Renea Hicks","No, I would not at all. First of all, that three-day window was a -- a chance for the -- the legislature -- the governor to come back and say, I will call the legislature in special session."
"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","If you're -- if you're -- if you're right about the jurisdiction, that there is no injunction, what happens next?"
"Max Renea Hicks","Well, I can tell you what we hope happens next."
"Neil Gorsuch","Counsel, are you suggesting you're not going to seek an injunction?"
"Max Renea Hicks","No."
"Neil Gorsuch","But -- but it's your intention to seek an injunction on the basis of your --"
"Max Renea Hicks","For the Rodriguez plaintiffs, I believe we will ask --"
"Neil Gorsuch","Counsel -- counsel, the question is --"
"Max Renea Hicks","Yes."
"Neil Gorsuch","-- if I might."
"Max Renea Hicks","We -- yes."
"Neil Gorsuch","You intend to seek an injunction on the basis of the order presently before us?"
"Max Renea Hicks","Yes."
"Neil Gorsuch","Okay."
"Max Renea Hicks","But -- but I emphasize there is -- there was pretty strong indication that we aren't going to be successful in getting it for the 2018 elections."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Do you think we lack jurisdiction if the order doesn't contain the word ""injunction"" or ""order"" but has the practical effect of doing that?"
"Max Renea Hicks","I -- I'll do a two-level answer."
"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","Has -- has the practical effects been applied in the 1253 context as distinguished from 1292?"
"Max Renea Hicks","It never has."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Counsel --"
"Max Renea Hicks","-- under Appendix B or whatever."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Counsel, you were the one who said you wanted to have one more word on the jurisdictional issue."
"Max Renea Hicks","Sorry."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","On the -- on the merits, it seems a strong argument, which you dismiss as just sort of wanting to end the litigation, which is usually a good thing, for the legislature to say: Okay, this is the plan, I understand it's preliminary and all that, but to move things along, this is the plan the district court drew."
"Max Renea Hicks","Right."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, they were not changed, but that -- surely, the district court could draw a map; you don't have to change every single district when you're -- you're looking at what you think is an appropriate map for two -- two elections to go forward under."
"Max Renea Hicks","I understand that, but in this one, there were -- half of the Texas congressional districts were not touched in the interim map, not touched at all, including these two --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Does -- is your answer different if they did alter every single district in Texas?"
"Max Renea Hicks","Well, my answer is it would then be a court-drawn map in the districts, and it would be court-drawn."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","How -- how -- how many of the Texas districts were redrawn or altered?"
"Max Renea Hicks","Only -- there were -- there are 36 districts; 18 of them were altered in some way and 18 of them were untouched."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, as to the district -- as to the congressional districts that are at issue here to start, did the district court simply rubber-stamp what had been presented to it, or did it engage in a pretty thorough, thoughtful analysis of the legality of those districts?"
"Max Renea Hicks","It did as thorough an analysis, I believe, as it could under the constraints."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Why don't you talk about one of the districts."
"Max Renea Hicks","The concept was one of two alternatives."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But they recommended this as one of the alternatives, right?"
"Max Renea Hicks","Right. It is, but there was --"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Linking -- linking San Antonio and -- and Austin, and they said there was a community of interest."
"Max Renea Hicks","It said it didn't know for sure whether there was a community of interest. But the important thing about this is there was no evidence -- under a racial gerrymandering test, they have to survive strict scrutiny. And so, on the strict scrutiny side, the Texas legislature had nothing -- nothing in front of it that suggested that there was problem with racially polarized voting that would require the creation of this district."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I thought there was evidence that there was racially polarized voting in the district as a whole."
"Max Renea Hicks","There is -- the state offered no evidence at all on that."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","You offered evidence about Travis County."
"Max Renea Hicks","Yes."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","At the time it acted, it had the district court's opinion, did it not?"
"Max Renea Hicks","At the time in 2013?"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Yeah. Isn't what we're looking at?"
"Max Renea Hicks","At the time it acted in 2013 -- yes, it did, and the district court said we need more facts."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","You've got a couple more minutes too."
"Max Renea Hicks","Okay."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, counsel. Ms. Riggs."
"Allison J. Riggs","Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court does not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal, but if it proceeds to the merits, the district court properly applied the Arlington Heights framework to analyze the intent of the 2013 legislature in reenacting some of the same state house districts it had deliberately designed in 2011 to cancel out or minimize the voting strength of black and Latino voters in Texas. And using that correct legal standard, the district court concluded that the intent of the legislature in 2013 was, in fact, to maintain and perpetuate its ill-gotten and racially discriminatory 2011 gains."
"Allison J. Riggs","Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court does not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal, but if it proceeds to the merits, the district court properly applied the Arlington Heights framework to analyze the intent of the 2013 legislature in reenacting some of the same state house districts it had deliberately designed in 2011 to cancel out or minimize the voting strength of black and Latino voters in Texas. And using that correct legal standard, the district court concluded that the intent of the legislature in 2013 was, in fact, to maintain and perpetuate its ill-gotten and racially discriminatory 2011 gains."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, has there -- has there ever been appellate review of the district court's determination -- findings as to the 2011 plan? Do you -- do you think that we should just accept those findings as givens? If you're going to place a lot of weight on them, would we not have to review those?"
"Allison J. Riggs","They would be subject to a clearly erroneous standard."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, we can ask General Keller that on rebuttal, but I didn't understand them to say that we agree that all of the findings that were made as to the 2011 plan were correct, and we don't wish to -- we -- we -- we accept them all."
"Allison J. Riggs","I'm certain they don't accept them."
"Sonia Sotomayor","I'm sorry, there's -- there's a difference between pulling out Republicans and pulling out Democrats."
"Allison J. Riggs","The district court's findings were based on the fact that precincts were split."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","I'm sorry, I've lost track of the -- which districting are you talking about with respect to 105? Was it 20 -- the 2011 or 20 --"
"Allison J. Riggs","2011."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Okay."
"Allison J. Riggs","And -- and, likewise, in Nueces County, importantly, the district court didn't have all of the -- I'm sorry, I meant to say Bell County, House District 54 in Bell County."
"Neil Gorsuch","Well --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Are these --"
"Neil Gorsuch","-- what -- what are we -- sorry."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Go ahead. Are -- are these districts that the district court in entering its preliminary map looked at? Is that your -- is that where I am on this, is that these are things that the district court changed but didn't have this additional information before it?"
"Allison J. Riggs","The district court didn't change these districts in the 2012 interim plan, but the house interim order was only 12 pages long."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","It did it -- it did it when? In the 2012 order?"
"Allison J. Riggs","It -- it did it when it issued the 2011 opinion."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Okay."
"Allison J. Riggs","It -- between the remand to this Court on January 20, 2012, and when the plan needed to be -- was constructed, February 28, I don't think the court had the time or all of the evidence to do this very delicate balancing."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","But if you're the Attorney General or -- or the -- the legislature in Texas and you want to take your best shot at a plan that will be accepted by the district court, wouldn't you take the plan that the district court drafted?"
"Allison J. Riggs","You might take that as a starting point."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, who was doing the masking? The district court when it drew up the preliminary plan?"
"Allison J. Riggs","No, the legislature in -- in invoking the adoption of the 2012 interim plan as having been a safe harbor, essentially, is the one masking."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","That's --"
"Neil Gorsuch","Counsel, what do we do -- I'm sorry."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Go ahead."
"Neil Gorsuch","All right."
"Allison J. Riggs","Well, there is and I think this Court's provided that guidance in recent cases as well, but -- consistent with instruction dating as far back as the '90s."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But what is your evidence that the state adopted the plan previously approved by the court for an invidious reason?"
"Allison J. Riggs","The evidence that the district court looked at in -- in arriving at that conclusion and -- and drawing the inference from the evidence in front of it was multiple -- multifaceted. One was that the -- the district court -- the legislature ignored the explicit warnings of the district court that its ruling was preliminary; it wasn't done looking."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","The advice -- the advice of what? That it was preliminary? The original opinion was preliminary?"
"Allison J. Riggs","So that's the particular piece of advice from that exhibit that the district court cited, but that exhibit, Joint Exhibit 15.3, contains other advice from legislative counsel, Mr. Archer, in which he explains to members of the committee that House District 54, where minority voters had been fractured, cut in half, and stranded in two Anglo districts, might have a target on its back, and that the legislature, if it wanted to avoid being found guilty of intentional discrimination, ought to consider reuniting that -- that district. So this is the evidence that they had in front of them."
"Stephen G. Breyer","What -- what is the law on the -- what is the law, in your opinion, not the facts, if you assume the following: One, there is an old plan and a state legislature thinks, you know, this old plan might really have been discriminatory; I wasn't here then, I didn't do it, but I see the point. Two, there is a judge who says this is okay, but, remember, I haven't seen all the evidence, I might change my mind, please 1,000 cautions."
"Allison J. Riggs","The law is still Arlington Heights and that even though the bishops determined that there may be a motivating -- a factor that --"
"Stephen G. Breyer","No, they determined that's the real reason."
"Allison J. Riggs","So the law I think -- that I would point Your Honors to is the Guinn and Lane line of cases where, when a statute is enacted and -- and struck down for being unconstitutional and then reenacted the next year, if it partakes too much of the initial constitutional infirmity, it cannot stand under the Constitution. I would also add, though, that wanting to end the litigation, even if it's coming from a -- a good place, doesn't end the constitutional scrutiny."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","And that -- and that -- don't you have to suggest that that was the intent that the district court had when it imposed the interim plan? Because keep in mind, this -- this evil intent that you're attributing comes from adopting the plan that the district court adopted and let the elections go forward under for two cycles."
"Allison J. Riggs","Well, the intent doesn't have to encompass any racial animus."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","But the intent doesn't have to encompass any racial animus?"
"Allison J. Riggs","No."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Not a deep, hateful place."
"Allison J. Riggs","I -- I -- intentional racial discrimination certainly attaches where there's a purposeful intent to keep a cohesive minority group from exercising the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice where they might otherwise have it, absent that intervention, but I don't think that's the same thing as racial animus. Very briefly, I would like to note that regardless of what this Court does on the questions of intent, in the House case, we have two districts, two claims that are independent of any intent, and one is House District 90, which I already spoke with -- about with Justice Gorsuch. The other is the Section 2 effects claim in Nueces County, and there the dispute boils down to a very narrow question."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, this would be very important going forward."
"Allison J. Riggs","No."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I thought that's what you were just saying."
"Allison J. Riggs","No."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Yeah, and did the district court find that? I thought the district court did not find that you can create two performing districts in Nueces County."
"Allison J. Riggs","It said there was some question about whether they were actually going to be performing."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","You can have another minute if you'd like."
"Allison J. Riggs","The -- the -- the only thing I would add to that, Justice Alito, is that the court said that the -- this was just the liability stage."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Yeah, and to --"
"Allison J. Riggs","And if you --"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","-- and to establish liability, is it not necessary to show that you could create another performing district?"
"Allison J. Riggs","Yes."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","And did the district court find that you could do that, and is it not true that one of the plaintiffs' experts found that one of these districts, if you split Nueces County in half, would not perform one time in 35 elections and the other one -- in the other, it would perform seven times in 35 elections?"
"Allison J. Riggs","I misspoke earlier."
"Sonia Sotomayor","I'm sorry."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank -- please."
"Sonia Sotomayor","Was 90 a Gingles test, or was it an intentional discrimination finding?"
"Allison J. Riggs","Neither, Your Honor."
"Sonia Sotomayor","And I don't think we need to prove that fact of -- of whether you create a -- a majority or minority; is that correct?"
"Allison J. Riggs","Right, Your Honor, just that race predominated without a compelling interest and race was not used in a narrowly tailored fashion."
"Sonia Sotomayor","So, I guess --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank -- I'm sorry."
"Scott A. Keller","I'll start very briefly with jurisdiction."
"Scott A. Keller","I'll start very briefly with jurisdiction."
"Sonia Sotomayor","So why don't we remand --"
"Scott A. Keller","And also that reversed the burden --"
"Sonia Sotomayor","-- then all of this just proves to me that, at best, all you get is a vacate this order and send it back under the right legal test."
"Scott A. Keller","Well, but in addition to those three major legal errors, there's also the fact that these findings were clearly erroneous. First of all, there is no evidence, and you heard no evidence whatsoever today, that somehow the 2013 legislature was trying to mask an invidious intent that it had either carried over or not."
"Sonia Sotomayor","It's a very simple argument."
"Scott A. Keller","But that -- that -- that hinges completely on one Texas Legislative Council member, Jeff Archer."
"Sonia Sotomayor","Well, I have --"
"Scott A. Keller","-- offered a map --"
"Sonia Sotomayor","-- I have two questions."
"Scott A. Keller","But --"
"Sonia Sotomayor","-- on the basis of race, is that correct?"
"Scott A. Keller","And I'm referring to Nueces County, and that was a vote dilution effect claim."
