"Very Profound Historical site.","1. The access to the Acropolis is very well designed, and we did not wait long in line.
2. The stone structures up close are really moving.
3. Around the Acropolis is very good food and entertainment","November 2017","Acropolis","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","attractions","5.0","4.5"
"A Very Good Value","The rooms were spacious, and very clean. This is not a 4 Star Hotel, nor is the Price. It is much better then a Motel 6, Red Roof Inn, etc. The Inn Room Coffee and fridge was very nice, and the rooms seemed spacious. The front lobby is undergoing improvements, and the manager Mike is always improving the place. I expect it to be even better on our next visit.The rooms were spacious, and very clean.","April 2015","Salida Inn & Monarch Suites","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33630-d84815-Reviews-Salida_Inn_Monarch_Suites-Salida_Chaffee_County_Colorado.html","Salida, Colorado","hotels","4.0","4.5"
"The Kidnapping - Reallly Fun","Played last night our second challenge with my girl friend and her 16 yr old son, and my 16 year old son, and his 16 year old friend. It was a blast and sloving the clues came quickly at first but we stalled a little. Didn't get out but enjoyed the hour tremendously. I plan to do another one with my super smart girl friend !","March 2015","Breakout Games - Lexington","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g39588-d7352030-Reviews-Breakout_Games_Lexington-Lexington_Kentucky.html","Lexington, Kentucky","attractions","5.0","5.0"
