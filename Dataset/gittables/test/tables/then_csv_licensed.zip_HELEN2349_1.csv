"Disappointed","We were there on our first day in Norway with a tour. I phoned a week earlier and requested a room on a high floor with a view. Howver I received the opposite, I went to the reception to complain and they werent interested. The hotel is nice and clean and very near to the airport.","July 2019","Scandic Fornebu","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1534722-d3564292-Reviews-Scandic_Fornebu-Fornebu_Baerum_Municipality_Akershus_Eastern_Norway.html","Fornebu, Norway","hotels","3.0","4.0"
