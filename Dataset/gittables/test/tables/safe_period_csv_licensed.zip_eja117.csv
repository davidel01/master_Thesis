"Gorgeous place and people","Loved this harbor. One of the best places I've ever been. Went there in April 2019. A gorgeous cafe. A jewelry store to die for right down the road owned by a very enthusiastic young woman, who spoke to me extensively about her theory that Odysseus' bed was from an olive tree. Was brought here on a tour by Makis of Ithaka Taxi.","April 2020","Kioni Harbour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3396938-d8537630-Reviews-Kioni_Harbour-Kioni_Ithaca_Ionian_Islands.html","Ithaca, Greece","attractions","5.0","4.5"

"I'm glad I did it. Somewhat helpful. Gives you a fine sense of Athens","The Piraeus and Riviera lines are a tad disappointing. They take a while and the traffic is pretty rough in Piraeus. But I'm still glad I did it. Renting a car in Athens seems impractical. People drive very fast, I didn't know the roads, and I couldn't figure out where or how people parked, but I still want to see the area if I can and I didn't want to be limited to only a small walking area. The Riviera area is a nice drive, but there's not tons to see. We did this in April and even in broad daylight it can get pretty cold at some point. You may want to bring your own headphones. The drivers speak reasonable English and are very helpful. I did use this service to help me navigate the city a little bit, which saved some time and money. The buses go to the cruise ships in Piraeus so it's a good resource for the cruise people. It's a fine activity for your first day or so to get a sense of the area or for when you are tired of walking and need a rest.","April 2019","City Sightseeing Athens & Beach Riviera Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11448070-City_Sightseeing_Athens_Beach_Riviera_Hop_On_Hop_Off_Bus_Tour-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","activities","3.0","4.0"
"Was ok, especially under the circumstances.","Was here in April on one of those G.O. Tours. We all loved the spinach pie thing they brought out first or second. The vegetable plate was good. I didn't really like the chicken on the bone but I rarely like meat on the bone anyway and my wife and kid did like it. They were kind of rushed. I was at a fun table with two Irish, one Brit, and 2 Chileans. I liked the interior and exterior of the place. I would consider coming back if I were in the area. I wish I had gone with the menu. I would have liked to see what they had. I've seen some good looking pictures of the place. Someone at the table asked for gluten free and it looked like they got some sort of stuffed pepper or tomato or something. It looked pretty good and the person said it was.","April 2019","Restaurant Chalet Maniati","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189408-d6597330-Reviews-Restaurant_Chalet_Maniati-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html","Delphi, Greece","restaurants","3.0","2.5"
"First game for kid","If it's someone's first game (basically a kid) you can go to the office of fan relations (or something like that) and get a large pin, sticker, and wrist band for the kid. The Red Sox seem to actually own the streets and alleys next to the park so they cut it off and make it into sorta a complex, so you see an area you want to go to but you can't until they let you in. There are people that check bags and do metal detectors. We got in the no bags line over to the right and it went way faster. People start lining up way before they let you in, which seems unnecessary to me. There are good places around the park. Don't forget sun screen. Decent concessions in the park. If you're gonna drive you gotta be careful. The beers can be pretty big. They don't do paper tickets any more I don't think. They expect the ticket to be on your smart phone. Mine was a forwarded text to my android phone and I had no problem, but I had everything printed out too.","June 2019","Fenway Park","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60745-d105250-Reviews-Fenway_Park-Boston_Massachusetts.html","Boston, Massachusetts","attractions","4.0","4.5"

Very loud idiots that were very loud for a long time at 3am. Pretty meager breakfast. I do not understand why so many hotels don't have locks on bathroom doors.

"Look out for the viper snakes. It's pretty overgrown at the moment","There are some viper snakes that like to sun themselves. I'm told they're on both Ithaca and Kefalonia.

It's a pretty incredible place and I think excavations are set to restart soon. It is up high on the side of a hill and I agree it's not the easiest place to find.

He was a careful driver who knew all the spots. It was about 35 Euro per hour. I'd do it again. Driving in Ithaca seemed difficult to me as many drivers seem to drive fast and Ithaca, in particular has a lot of mountains and some animals to be careful of. It would have been difficult to know where I was without this.

"Was excellent.","This was a great place in a great location on a nice street near the Acropolis. It seems very popular and busy. They had good variety and were quite fast. You might not be able to finish your appetizer by the time they arrive with the entree. Your biggest challenge might be all the restaurants near it trying to pull you into their place.

The first driver said ""There are like 23 museums in this city"" and I said ""Yes but there is only one National Archaeological Museum."" Once we finally got here (don't get confused with the University that sorta looks like it) it was pretty good. You can check your bag for free. A great courtyard/cafe/restaurant with trees. Phenomenal exhibits that the volunteers can't tell you much about (I tried with two of them). Very happy we went.

"Glad we did it","We took this after taking another bus tour. We didn't want to deal with driving and parking in Greece because there is so much fast driving and driving on the sides of cliffs and things. We also like to be comfortable. The first stop was at the Corinthian Canal. It is a short stop to use bathrooms. It's a decent time to buy a snack or something because it can be hard to eat early in the morning. But you get warned about pick pockets and there are beggars right in your way on the bridge in the middle of the business day. It's honestly a disgrace, but I guess that's not the tour company's fault. The stop at Mycenae is great as long as you don't have a teenager with you trying to tell you what way you have to go and that you have to get back to the bus. The museum at Epidaurus is small. Don't let your little children wander and don't lean on anything. You don't have a ton of time at Epidaurus and it is steep to get up high, but it is like they say with acoustics that are other worldly. The restaurant you go to is at a really nice hotel. I didn't like the wine at first but got more used to it. They served these soft hamburger things with a nice sauce. I liked them but my wife didn't. While at Mycenae you also get to visit a large tomb. There is also a 20 minute seaside stop at the town of Nafplio, which is nice, but I'm not sure what they expect you to do in 20 minutes.","April 2019","Mycenae and Epidaurus Day Trip from Athens","https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11469956-Mycenae_and_Epidaurus_Day_Trip_from_Athens-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","activities","3.0","4.0"
"Line looks reeealllly long, but moves a lot faster than I thought","Gorgeous place. You can get private tours that are sanctioned that allows you to cut the line but the line moves way faster than I thought. There are 5 booths and 2 are cash only. It's kinda funny from a weather perspective. It can be sorta hot and sunny but at the same time cold because it's very windy. So layer I guess. Huge crowds in some places. Seems very difficult to access with a wheelchair. Even seems difficult to access if you are unsteady or in bad health. If that is your deal I'd call ahead. Your teenager might not care about it. Who cares what they think? I liked the bigness of the place. Once you get up there you have a ton of space to move around. You will probably be solicited in line for private tours. I don't think you need them. I admit at first I was having a tough time finding the entrance, but just keep on following your instincts and follow the crowds. It's big circle and you gotta go up. You are totally exposed up there and it can rain so think about that. I heard a rumor three people got hurt near the flag pole by lightning. So if it seems like lightning might happen be careful. It doesn't seem to make much sense to me that you can buy a ticket that covers the Theater of Dionysus when you can't go in it. All I could find that you could do was look at it and it seemed pretty open and impossible to hide.","April 2019","Acropolis","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","attractions","5.0","4.5"
"Delphi full day tour from Athens","We got this tour through our hotel. Things started interestingly. The hotel and tour company communicated well and informed us that because the Athens traffic was terrible they were sending a cab to pick us up and take us to their base at no cost to us. The driver was well dressed and this worked fine. We didn't want the hassle of driving in Greece. The roads aren't ""bad"" but they can be tricky. Sometimes narrow. Sometimes at the edge of cliffs. Sometimes the drivers are very aggressive. We wanted comfort and some affordability. I'd say we accomplished that. The guide George was ok. He had to do double duty because the tour was in both English and Italian. My wife liked Delphi a lot. It is a gorgeous place. It takes a while to get to and then you don't have lots of time there. If you are in bad shape or have bad knees it will be tough to get to the top and back in time. The bus gives you very specific times to be back. If I were older I would try to communicate to the guide about skipping the museum. The museum isn't so big and some of the things are replicas and the group makes it a tad crowded. Probably the two best things are a large silver bull given to the Oracle and the large sphinx that guarded the site. There is a stop at a nice road stop on the way. There is another stop in a village very close to Delphi right in front of a store. They encourage you to use the bathrooms and the owner really tries to sell you hard on what he has. He has some nice stuff. My wife got a table cloth. The restaurant is ok. I didn't like my chicken on the bone, but my wife and kid did. One of my table mates insisted on gluten free so they brought her a stuffed pepper or tomato or something. It looked pretty good and she said it was. Lunch is a fine deal. Drinks not included. I have zero complaints. I don't think I could have done this much better. We got back and the sun was still up for a while. It's about a 7:30am leave time give or take. If you have serious fears of heights you may want to reevaluate this tour. You know that gorgeous picture of a circular temple at Delphi? The Tholos? We never got to go near it. I couldn't even see how to get to it. I could see it not that far away but we didn't go there. I'm not sure why not. I don't recall seeing a lot of people by it. It's fairly small. Seeing the Temple of Apollo and the treasuries up close is interesting. There is a stadium up at the top and a theater. We were dropped off close to our hotel. The British girl at our table made an interesting point. She said ""Seeing as today is a national free museum day I wonder why we don't get some money back. Our museum tickets are included but the price wasn't reduced at all."" Delphi seemed very difficult for a wheelchair bound person to visit. If that affects you I definitely think you should make some calls. This tour probably isn't for you if that is the case. Another huge reason I'm glad I did this is that parking seemed undefined and confusing.","April 2019","G. O.

"The. Best. Staff. Ever.","The staff was excellent. Very thoughtful and knowledgable. Very proactive. Competitively excellent. Everyone from Alexandros, to Georgios, to Nikos, Vagelis, to the girls that kind of look the same, to the tall guy with glasses and the kitchen staff. Probably one of the best teams I've seen anywhere in almost any industry. All hard workers doing many things. Good listeners. Excellent language skills. Very good restaurant. Good location near the US embassy. Clean and comfortable areas. An almost full bathtub. Not the best wifi. Reasonable sized room. Should have had an extra lock on the door and a lock on the bathroom door. A good restaurant nearby. Probably the best breakfasts I've ever had. Very popular with school trips, which can make it loud. One of the best stays I've had anywhere. It totally blew away another ""4 star"" place I stayed at in Athens. I wish I had stayed at Airotel Alexandros again.","April 2019","Airotel Alexandros","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228918-Reviews-Airotel_Alexandros-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","hotels","5.0","4.0"
"No more Marriott for me. Nothing resembling 4 star","Breakfast for your guests is a standard in 2019. This is substandard. Marriott can't afford this? The wifi was a circular joke. They expect you to sign up for something to use it and it's difficult to do. I think if you are on for a very short period of time you get charged $9.95. No locks on the bathroom doors! They have some stupid slide door thing. Went to use the coffee machine and it was a pain because it wasn't plugged in. Needed to stick my arm into the small area behind the fridge to use it. Kind of a small bathroom/shower situation and I'm not a big person. Was about a $65 cab ride from Boston Logan. I'm just not using Marriott again. It was just a nickel/dime dumpster fire of a hotel situation. Marriott used to be good. That was a very long time ago.","April 2019","Boston Marriott Newton","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g41707-d89789-Reviews-Boston_Marriott_Newton-Newton_Massachusetts.html","Newton, Massachusetts","hotels","1.0","3.5"
"Good stuff","One of the better Mexican places I have been. My wife loved it. I liked it. The kid eventually shut up and accepted it even though he hadn't wanted to go. Perky hard working waitress. Located next to a gas station/convenience store and across from a strip mall so you can do some one stop shopping/eating.","February 2019","La Carona Mexican Restaurant","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46213-d4607231-Reviews-La_Carona_Mexican_Restaurant-Rochester_New_Hampshire.html","Rochester, New Hampshire","restaurants","4.0","4.0"
"Had what I wanted/needed","I liked this place. Wasn't too crowded on a 3 day weekend. Well located right next to a fun Mexican restaurant and a gas station/convenience store and across the street from a strip mall with other stuff like a Starbucks and whatnot. Had the pool and hot tub I wanted. Our room with two beds was fairly spacious. It was very pet friendly. So friendly one large dog jumped up on me in the stair well. No weights of any kind in the exercise room. I think they should get a few. The place is under some renovation so it will be nicer in the future. Desk staff and other staff work pretty hard and answer all your questions. Fine standard breakfast for a place like this.","February 2019","Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Rochester","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g46213-d675006-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Hotel_Suites_Rochester-Rochester_New_Hampshire.html","Rochester, New Hampshire","hotels","4.0","4.5"
"Yup. It's a Buffalo Wild Wings.","It's in a location in a strip mall type place next to a Dollar Store so you can do some one stop shopping. They were nice enough to change two TVs for me. Not too crowded. Nice waitress with glasses. Nobody gave me a hard time or even batted an eye when I spilled my beer. I admire that they won't give you the very alcoholic beers in more than 16 ounces. Liked the options.","February 2019","Buffalo Wild Wings","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46213-d3667608-Reviews-Buffalo_Wild_Wings-Rochester_New_Hampshire.html","Rochester, New Hampshire","restaurants","4.0","3.5"
"I had a better breakfast this morning that Prince William or the Pope.","One of the best breakfasts I ever had anywhere. The specials were creative and I'm not gonna even tell you what they were. Consider giving a 100% tip. Family friendly as it seemed there was a very young daughter of a waitress helping out. I overheard another waitress say she got into a car accident that morning. But there she was at work. Good folks and good food. A treasure. I read it had the best corned beef hash in NH. I'm not gonna argue. I was nervous there'd be a long wait. So I had my hotel call. They said about 10 minutes and they were flipping fast. That was about right. That was on the Monday of a winter 3 day weekend.","February 2019","The Farmers Kitchen","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46085-d3544204-Reviews-The_Farmers_Kitchen-Farmington_New_Hampshire.html","Farmington, New Hampshire","restaurants","5.0","5.0"
"This franchise gets it.","This franchise and Choice Hotels pretty much get it. It's not complicated. Fine breakfast, parking, wifi, pool, TV, location. Safe. Fairly clean. Affordable. Responsive staff. That's all you really need and want. They hit all the boxes. They've got sorta that popcorn ceiling and walls thing that reduces noise. Right next to a convenience store/gas station and about 2 miles down from a mall. The pictures are fairly accurate. Staff worked to keep plowing the parking lot while it was snowing.","January 2019","Quality Inn Loudon - Concord","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g46146-d239989-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Loudon_Concord-Loudon_New_Hampshire.html","Loudon, New Hampshire","hotels","4.0","3.5"

"Liked. Worth it.","Perhaps a tad pricey but maybe worth it. You have to pay to get in, then you have to pay again for rides at kiosks. Very nice beer garden with fun candy I had never seen. Wife and tween loved it for different reasons. I heard a rumor Disney was based on this place and that makes total sense. Good food options. Good relaxation options. Somehow manages to sorta be crowded and not crowded at the same time. I never thought the lines for rides were toooo bad. I don't think there's parking, but Copenhagen is pretty walkable, and I think there's decent public transportation in the area. I think a good time to enter is when it's sunny but will become sunset because then the lights turn on and are pretty fun. I drank a beer almost bigger than any I'd ever had but to my right were two women drinking beers much bigger.","August 2018","Tivoli Gardens","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189541-d197738-Reviews-Tivoli_Gardens-Copenhagen_Zealand.html","Copenhagen, Denmark","attractions","5.0","4.5"
"I liked it. Bigger than maybe I imagined.","This is a very large place. You could easily spend hours here. I don't recall if there is food/drink available, but there are good bathrooms. Even though it takes some uphill walking I might recommend getting up onto the ramparts to see around. The inner fort has two entrances, exits across little bridges. Then there is a large moat. On the outside of the moat in the Little Mermaid, which for some reason will be completely swamped with people. I think there's food/ice cream in this area. It's fairly picturesque. I don't recall any parking. The inner part is not crowded at all. The outside is ok, but busy.","August 2018","Kastellet","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189541-d245963-Reviews-Kastellet-Copenhagen_Zealand.html","Copenhagen, Denmark","attractions","4.0","4.0"
"Good touristy thing to do","This was a fun place to go. Nice and historical. Crown jewels. Nice grounds. About what you would expect. I don't think there's any parking. There are definitely stairs. I didn't pay much attention to that aspect of things. There's a cafe nearby. Fine bathrooms. Seems relatively safe in the sense that there's all sorts of cameras and soldiers nearby. I do like my castles and this didn't disappoint.","August 2018","Rosenborg Castle","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189541-d197741-Reviews-Rosenborg_Castle-Copenhagen_Zealand.html","Copenhagen, Denmark","attractions","4.0","4.5"
"Pretty good","Kinda popular and crowded. There were three tour buses there Sunday afternoon on Columbus Day weekend. The maple nature path was one of the most gorgeous paths I've ever been on, but it's only about 175 yards long. I didn't try the maple maze. I saw the video on how they made it and did the testing and learned a lot. The maple creme ice cream with maple dust is one of the best things I ever ate and there's a good place to eat it with a good view of the world. Tons of maple related and VT related stuff to buy.","October 2018","Morse Farm Maple Sugarworks","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57324-d2216699-Reviews-Morse_Farm_Maple_Sugarworks-Montpelier_Vermont.html","Montpelier, Vermont","attractions","4.0","4.5"
"Didn't really work for us","You definitely need to put aside a lot of time to do this. We gave up after a while, and when we saw the map it looked to us like the objective was placed in a spot we thought we weren't supposed to go, so we never would have found it.

I would agree you should definitely arrive before 1PM if possible.

You may think you'll be cold and you may actually end up pretty hot. They recommend bringing water with you.","October 2018","Great Vermont Corn Maze","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57225-d623441-Reviews-Great_Vermont_Corn_Maze-Danville_Northeast_Kingdom_Vermont.html","Danville, Vermont","attractions","3.0","4.5"
"Good server","Pretty good. One young guy running the whole thing and doing pretty well Columbus Day weekend at about 3:45PM. My tween liked the chicken wings. Pretty decent burger type stuff.

"Straightforward good","I was with a table of 5 and a half and everyone was satisfied. I'm 40 and I'm under the impression it's been in business for a long time. Server was good. Decent variety.

There's nothing not to like.","October 2018","Happy Hour Restaurant Inc","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57443-d1889879-Reviews-Happy_Hour_Restaurant_Inc-Wells_River_Vermont.html","Wells River, Vermont","restaurants","4.0","4.0"
"It was fine.","I like Wendy's a lot. There were a lot of young people trying their best with an supervisor. during the middle of the day. It took a little longer than I'm used to but they got the order right and I'd rather take the extra minutes to get it right. The coke machine was broken so they got me the drink themselves. I found nothing really wrong at all. I know the employees at the car dealership across the street eat here so that's a local endorsement. I like Wendy's a lot.

"Get here quick","it was definitely worth it. My 11 year old loves the electronics. You gotta fight that and I do. However there is no way I can get a kid to spend more than 2 hours or so doing this, and that's too bad because the ships are huge. The battleship in particular is massive and I feel like it could take all day to go through it. That's probably the toughest part. Your kid miiiiggghht get bored fast, whereas you want to be there 5 hours. Lots of parts of the ships are off limits. There is actually a restaurant in the battleship. There are all sorts of stuff to crawl through and whatnot. Some of this I feel like you should be in shape for. Lots of steep stairs. You can walk up close to two PT boats and see into them through cut outs. The kid liked the landing craft and two helicopters. Parking at 1:30 on a Saturday was just about impossible. I just barely managed it and got lucky. I didn't do the carousel. Your admission also gets you into the maritime museum just a block down the street but they close at 3PM. We walked through it really fast because we got there at 2:56PM. Lots of cool models. The submarine is the exact same kind they have at Pearl Harbor. I think they have sleep over nights.","September 2018","Battleship Cove","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g41564-d218880-Reviews-Battleship_Cove-Fall_River_Massachusetts.html","Fall River, Massachusetts","attractions","5.0","4.5"
"Good product.","I'm really surprised I forgot to review this place here.....however....I DID review it on google, so here is my review...""Good stuff. If you want something pretty smooth (great for summer) that will get you a little buzzeder than wine....this is your drink. A teeny itsy bit pricey, but cmon. They're from Vermont. What do you expect? Perfect for watching games of New England teams. Just a great drink. You don't need to go any further. It will impress connoisseurs and idiots alike. Just go for it.""

I think I was there last year.
I think I did the tasting. I don't think I did ice cream.

"Beat my expectations by a lot","Really beat my expectations big time. We were in the main house. Fairly quiet. Awesome lounge areas for coffee or TV.
