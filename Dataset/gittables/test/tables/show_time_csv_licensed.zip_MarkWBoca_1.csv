"Superb Food, Marvelous Service","Cabana El Rey does it all for an outstanding dining experience. Over more than a decade, I have joined numerous friends for lunch or dinner at Cabana. No matter what anyone orders, my friends delight in their fine meal, perfectly cooked and imaginatively presented. I have personally tried or been with others who ordered everything on the menu over the years. Everyone rejoices in Cabana's superb food.

My personal favorite meal begins with plantain chips and guacamole and salsa. Sangria, either red or white, complements every dinner. We then follow with paella marinera (seafood) with extra chorizo mixed in. Flan is my dessert, among many other delicious endings for a perfect meal. Large eater that I am, still I can only finish such a meal if I share it with my wife or friend. The portions are generous at Cabana, and its fun to share.

The most fantastic food falls short unless it is well-served by a helpful, friendly waiter. Although Angelo is my favorite waiter, all of the wait staff is superb at Cabana. Angelo is perfectly friendly without being intrusive in any way. He guides his guests to order according to their tastes, and makes sure that everything is just right. Long time manager Mario trains all of his waiters, and supervises them closely. His overall management brings everything together in the Cabana dining experience.

Southeast Florida has hundreds, maybe thousands of Latin fusion restaurants. But none of them provide a better dining experience than Cabana El Rey.","April 2021","Cabana El Rey","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34179-d642261-Reviews-Cabana_El_Rey-Delray_Beach_Florida.html","Delray Beach, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Poolside Restaurant Perfect for Lunch or Snack","Four of us enjoyed a delightful lunch at the poolside restaurant at the Marriott Sanibel Harbor Resort and Spa. I had a wonderful grilled grouper sandwich and my wife found the grilled chicken sandwich excellent.

"Nothing Special","Apollonia Grill is pleasant, but nothing special. It’s a decent place to meet friends and relax, but the food is mediocre at best.

My wife and I shared a Greek salad. The only things Greek about it were the tasteless feta cheese and the olives. Real Greek salad does not have lettuce, but Apollonia’s version was mostly lettuce. I ordered the moussaka. Real Greek Taverna moussaka is wonderfully layered meat, eggplant, potato, tomato sauce, topped by bechamel sauce or mashed potato occasionally. Apollonia’s version was cooked in a small casserole dish with all of the ingredients jumbled together.

Service was pleasant, parking was convenient.","March 2021","Apollonia Grill","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34618-d19112774-Reviews-Apollonia_Grill-Sarasota_Florida.html","Sarasota, Florida","restaurants","2.0","4.0"
"Lax in Pandemic Health and Safety","As a loyal longtime Hilton Honors member and big fan of Hilton standards, it is very painful for me to write a bad review of Homewood Suites by Hilton Sarasota. Also, Fina at the front desk is so gracious and welcoming, and many of the staff are very pleasant.

Still, Homewood is not supervising its staff effectively. This was our first hotel stay in more than a year, due to the coronavirus pandemic. We chose Homewood Suites after reading Hilton’s vigorous standards for healthy hotels during this awful pandemic. This particular Homewood Suites on their website goes into great detail about their health and safety precautions - especially their sanitizing room procedures and products. Each guest room is sealed with a blue sanitized door seal to indicate that it had been sanitized according to Hilton standards.

The problem is that the Homewood cleaning personnel by my observation do not uniformly wear masks and gloves when cleaning. I did not look for this. Just walking through the halls on my way to my car or to common areas, I noticed three different cleaners cleaning rooms without masks and gloves. In fairness, after I complained to Fina at the front desk, I observed improvement in cleaning staff mask-wearing and gloves-wearing.

I am not complaining about the flagrant disregard for mask precautions on the part of guests. I understand that’s part of Florida’s Governor’s celebration of forbidding mask mandates. I am complaining about Homewood’s failure to enforce their expressly guaranteed safety standards. I do not believe it’s the cleaners themselves. The fault lies in lax supervision by managers and supervisors.","March 2021","Homewood Suites by Hilton Sarasota","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34618-d543412-Reviews-Homewood_Suites_by_Hilton_Sarasota-Sarasota_Florida.html","Sarasota, Florida","hotels","1.0","4.0"
"Best Docents Anywhere in the World","We always make a visit to the Sarasota Art Museum a part of every trip to Sarasota. Housed in a repurposed high school, the spaces are magnificent, huge, airy, well lit galleries for modern art.

In the place of its own collection, the Sarasota Art Museum exhibits lots of work from one or two contemporary artists. Last year, the museum exhibited two different artists on the second and third floors. This year, almost all of the exhibition features the work of the German-Brazilian artist Jainaina Tschape.

The best part of the museum is its outstanding professional docents - all of them extremely knowledgeable, personable, and committed to giving personal private explanations of the artist and her art. For our visit, there were more docents than visitors. Even when we have visited on busy days, the many docents are eager to make your visit unforgettable.","March 2021","Sarasota Art Museum","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34618-d19723155-Reviews-Sarasota_Art_Museum-Sarasota_Florida.html","Sarasota, Florida","attractions","5.0","4.5"

"Alone Worth a Trip to St. Pete","The Dali must rank among the best little art museums in the world. Although it concentrates mostly on a fine collection of the Spanish artist Salvador Dali, it is a celebration of the transformative power of art. The architecture of the museum is art in itself. The Spanish cafe and outdoor sculpture garden could not possibly be more delightful. A really complete museum store is an experience of the world of art, even if you don’t buy anything.

This visit to the Dali, we went specifically for the immersive Van Gogh experience. Surrounded by projected paintings of the impressionist master, quotations from his letters to his brother and a great selection of music offer an emotional depth to the painter’s work and tragic life.","March 2021","The Dali Museum","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34607-d126833-Reviews-The_Dali_Museum-St_Petersburg_Florida.html","St. Petersburg, Florida","attractions","5.0","4.5"

"Eat In or Take Out, Still the Best Boca Deli","Although I always enjoy Ben's, I particularly appreciate them during the pandemic. Taking out deli, the food is still warm enough at home to eat without warming up in the oven. For whatever combination of reasons, deli seems particularly suited for taking out and eating at home.

Ben's does an especially good job of curbside delivery. Hannah is my favorite at bringing my food out to my car, but Angie is also quite good when Hannah isn't in.

"Cauliflower or Eggplant Pizza?","So much is so good at Anthony's. The salad is excellent and ample for two. We generally order both the mozzarella and the gorgonzola to sprinkle on our salad. Although the meatballs are very good as an appetizer, I have never had enough room for meatball, salad, and pizza. So one has to make difficult choices. Personally, I love the cauliflower pizza and the eggplant pizza. Sometimes I choose one, sometimes the other. Good either way.

Great service, reasonable prices.","February 2021","Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d2624812-Reviews-Anthony_s_Coal_Fired_Pizza-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"

Be sure to specify that they line your box with aluminum foil and wax paper to keep the crust fresh. The crust is the most difficult part of taking pizza out. Alternatively, one can restore the crust after a short stint in the oven.

Dominic's always makes the best pizza. On my recent visit, I was pleased to see my favorite waiter Mark bringing the pizza out to my car.

Thanks, Tony, for keeping us safe and healthy. And thanks, Tony, for continuing to serve the area's best pizza.","February 2021","Dominic's I Pizza and Pasta","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d4437340-Reviews-Dominic_s_I_Pizza_and_Pasta-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Best South Florida Greek","Taverna Kyma gets better all the time. Their large outdoor covered patio is ideal for cautious dining during the pandemic. But it is so popular that to is important to reserve ahead for parties of four or more. No reservations are permitted for two. But we have found that arriving early for an early dinner/late lunch when Kyma opens at 4 PM is the ideal time for superb service and socially distanced outdoor dining.

The Greek food at Taverna Kyma is as good as you can get this side of Greece. We have traveled extensively in Greece, and love Greek cuisine and culture. Taverna Kyma offers the absolutely best, most authentic Greek food in South Florida, with Greek music always in the background. Opa!

The complementary hummus and pita are excellent. We have tried many of their specialties, and love them all. Recently, we enjoyed the grilled octopus, the spanakopita, and the stuffed vegetables, after our horiatiki salad. Horiatiki is authentic Greek salad, which means no lettuce, but cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, olives, and a stuffed vine leaf thrown in for good measure. One salad is enough for two to share as a side salad.

On a recent visit, Denis was our server. But service is shared by Kyma staff, so lots of people pitch in. The prices are reasonable and moderate. One can have an exceptionally fine and authentically Greek meal for relatively little, but one can also have a big meal with all of the trimmings for a reasonable check. Really good!","February 2021","Taverna Kyma","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d644756-Reviews-Taverna_Kyma-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"

We always enjoy the tacos, which we order in a variety, two of each, lobster, tuna, and steak. The lobster and tuna are the best. Salads are wonderful and desserts should not be missed. At our last visit, Julien was our superb server, attentive, efficient, personable.","February 2021","Oli's Fashion Cuisine","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d19379352-Reviews-Oli_s_Fashion_Cuisine-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","3.5"

"Always Outstanding and Worth a Trip","Over the last ten years, GG's has consistently been among my favorite restaurants in South Florida. It is well worth traveling a long distance for a special occasion or for a lunch or dinner or brunch.

In our recent visit to GG's we joined a couple of our friends for an outdoor, socially-distance early dinner/late lunch, beginning at 3:30 in the afternoon. Because GG's is open from late morning straight through the evening, it is ideal for a meal at any hour. During this awful pandemic, when many of us are exercising such caution, GG's is perfect. They allowed us to park our own car in their parking lot, bypassing their pleasant and always competent valet. We had a beautiful table overlooking the intercostal waterway. Hand sanitizer is readily available throughout the restaurant. All wait staff and employees carefully observe all protocols for health and safety during the pandemic.

As we have done on most of our visits over the years to GG's, we enjoyed a marvelous seafood dinner, oysters on the half shell and shrimp as an appetizer, and a whole fish as our main course. The complementary rolls and butter are delicious - a temptation to fill up on them alone. Our oysters came in two varieties, nicely marked with a stir in each grouping, both delectable. The whole fish never comes better. This visit we had our whole fish fried, but I think that next time we will have it roasted, as we have had in the past. Either way, the fish is fresh and wonderful.

GG's always features outstanding service at every level. Our server Olena from the Ukraine was delightful with her knowledge of the food options, efficiency, and sense of humor. Raven at the front desk was very helpful, both in our making our reservation and welcoming us to the restaurant. And long-time manager Spiro oversees it all. As always, he is vitally concerned with every aspect of the dining experience his staff delivers.

In previous GG's visits, we have enjoyed their weekend brunch, second to none anywhere. At every time and for every occasion, GG's is outstanding. The quality of the food and service are well worth the price of the meal.","February 2021","GG's Waterfront Bar and Grill","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34296-d474088-Reviews-GG_s_Waterfront_Bar_and_Grill-Hollywood_Broward_County_Florida.html","Hollywood, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Welcome Middle Eastern Restaurant","Very few Middle Eastern restaurants are available in South Florida. Amar is a welcome new addition. The cuisine unifies the Arab world and Israel - in both of which I have spent a lot of time. I also lived in the Arab section of London for many years. So I am quite devoted to this cuisine, sometimes called ""Lebanese"" - but always delicious.

Amar offers authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. Its hummus (ground chickpeas in sesame) dip and baba ganoush (eggplant) dip, and stuffed vegetables are as good as anyplace in the Middle East - really superb. The fatoush salad, with pita chips in it, and their pita, baked on premises don't measure up. Even store-bought, packaged pita is better than what Amar bakes, and the pita chips are derived from what they bake.

Service is friendly and the prices are quite reasonable. On our recent visit, both Janet and Silvia served our table. Amar has three tables on the sidewalk in the front on Atlantic Avenue. Frankly, we did not find sitting out front very comfortable. Cars parallel parked right next to us, and the street noise did not make for a pleasant dining experience.

Nonetheless, Amar is an excellent option in the Delray Beach dining scene.","February 2021","Amar Mediterranean Bistro","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34179-d23125181-Reviews-Amar_Mediterranean_Bistro-Delray_Beach_Florida.html","Delray Beach, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"

"Gastronomic Heaven on Earth","We have been raving about Twenty Twenty Grille since they first opened. For superb American fusion fine dining, Twenty Twenty is the single outstanding restaurant in South Florida. Owners Chef Ron and his wife Rhonda (running the floor) offer peerless cuisine and service. Chef Ron carefully constructs seasonal menus from what is available and appropriate for each season, locally sourced if at all possible.

Each dish is artfully presented and cooked to perfection. Chef Ron will customize recipes for people with special dietary needs. Over the years, we have tried virtually every dish o every menu - all exceptional.

Among the starters, our favorites are ""duck duck taco"" and seafood sausage. Among the mains, we dream about the rack of lamb, the crab cakes, the duck, and recently the ribeye. At least one fresh fish is on every seasonal menu, and usually a vegetarian choice as well. For dessert, although we have tried everything, we keep coming back for the profiteroles. In addition to the various courses on the menu, every Twenty Twenty meal includes complementary home baked bread and artisan butter, an amuse bouche which Chef Ron concocts daily, a secret recipe palette cleanser sorbet, and macadamia brittle with dessert. On many occasions, Twenty Twenty offers tasting menus of virtually everything on the menu. Wine pairings are available with these tasting menus. The wine list is ample, and offers many wines by the glass.

On our most recent visit, Matteo was our server, as he has been many times before. A superb waiter, he is invariably helpful in making selections from the menu. His good humor and sweetness enhance the meal.

During this awful pandemic, Twenty Twenty Grille has done an extraordinary job arranging socially distanced tables with fans or heaters as needed. No other restaurant in South Florida has so masterfully handled the pandemic and the need to social distance. Bravo Twenty Twenty!

"Perfection in Dining - Best Brunch or Lunch in Boca","The Tin Muffin is one of those rare eating establishments which makes every meal a special occasion. The menu is imaginative and comprehensive. Each day there are specials in addition to the menu. My first meal at the Tin Muffin with a friend was so good I brought my wife back the next day. The daily specials were completely different.

Every day two different fresh-baked muffins are on offer. Spoiler alert, owner Phillip sends home every first-time diner with a gift-wrapped two muffin selection. Service is uniformly attentive and friendly. Bilyana (from Bulgaria) was a highlight of our lunch. She unobtrusively guided us to superb selections both on the menu and among the daily specials.

Most unforgettable dishes, besides the muffins, were the home-made (Everything is home-made at the Tin Muffin) lentil soup, the trio of salads, and the incredible peach cobbler for dessert. On the trio of salads, I selected the shrimp salad, the ham salad, and the curried chicken salad. Any of these dishes would be worth the trip.

The only downside to the Tin Muffin is the parking. My advice is take a little bit more time, and find a space on the street. Otherwise, the Tin Muffin is perfection in dining.","October 2020","Tin Muffin Cafe","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d495725-Reviews-Tin_Muffin_Cafe-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous","Dining doesn't come any better, anywhere. Twenty Twenty has been great from their start as a small, totally focused fine dining American cuisine mecca. Owned by Chef Ron Weisheit and his wife Rhonda, who hosts and supervises the wait staff, Twenty Twenty sources the best food, cooks it to perfection, and serves it artfully.

During this awful pandemic, Twenty Twenty has gotten even better. The food and presentation are the same. But Twenty Twenty is using a larger outdoor area to afford ample social distancing between tables, and even on the same larger table set up for two couples so that they can both stay socially distant and yet be together.

We were joined recently by longtime good friends who drove up from Miami to join us in our Twenty Twenty adventure in fine dining during the pandemic. Ron and Rhonda set our tables up together under a canopy, with its own dedicated pair of fans. Every server on the floor observes prescribed health protocol with masks and gloves, as does the kitchen.

My wife and I each enjoyed one of our favorite starters, duck duck tacos. For our main, we shared a veal porterhouse. We enjoyed glasses of prosecco to open, and a recommended Pinot Noir from their fine wine list. Every diner at Twenty Twenty also gets complimentary home-baked artisan bread and craft Twenty Twenty butter (on their website, you can choose your butter from a variety of flavors). An amuse bouche introduces every meal. A mystery intermezzo sorbet punctuates the middle of the meal, and complimentary cashew brittle comes with your check.

However much we always love Twenty Twenty we appreciate the Weisheit's masterpiece restaurant, it has risen to new heights during this awful period.

Last night, my wife and I shared a crab cake and a yellowtail snapper. She had the mixed salad, I ordered the Caesar salad with extra anchovies. We ordered four sides of spinach Maria, which we will use to cover baked potatoes for the next several days. We shared a delicious slice of key lime pie for dessert.

"Take Out Almost As Good As Eating In","Take out can never measure up to dining in. The food can be every bit as good. But a big part of the dining experience is relaxing, and having someone else wait on you and having someone else cook the dinner, and then someone else does the dishes.

Cabana El Rey's food to take out is every bit as delectable. But I miss the superb waiters which translate outstanding food into a superb dining experience.

To take out this week, I ordered my usual favorite, paella marinera with chorizo added with a side order of maduros. For those not totally addicted to Cabana's outstanding Latin fusion cuisine, what I ordered was the mixed seafood with rice main dish with Spanish sausage slices mixed, with a side order of fried sweet plantains (a banana relative).

I still missed all of my favorite waiters from manager Mario's superlative staff. But someday, we'll all be back. In the meantime, I will let Cabana's wonderful takeout sustain my addiction to their dining experience.","July 2020","Cabana El Rey","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34179-d642261-Reviews-Cabana_El_Rey-Delray_Beach_Florida.html","Delray Beach, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Great Take-Out","Few restaurants serve food as well to take out as they do to dine in. But Ben’s does.

What I miss the most about dining in at Ben’s are the pickle bowl and the cole slaw - both complementary and unlimited.

But take out is the same food. And same Ben’s excellence.

Although I look forward to returning to eating in after the pandemic, taking out will suffice in the meanwhile.","July 2020","Ben’s Kosher Foods and Kosher Catering","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d885839-Reviews-Ben_s_Kosher_Foods_and_Kosher_Catering-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"
"The Best Ice Cream and Social Distancing","Carvel always offered wonderful frozen desserts. During this pandemic, the ice cream is the same. But Carvel does the best job around enforcing social distancing and mask wearing. A big sign on the door requires masks. Entrance is limited and distance is enforced.

"A Particularly Good Ice Cream and Fro Yo Store","This Brendy’s has a big sign on the door requiring masks and sells them to anyone entering without a mask. Everyone follows the rules there because it’s the standard of the store.

The tables outdoors are nicely placed. And the fro yo and ice cream are excellent, as always.","July 2020","Brendy's","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d9593953-Reviews-Brendy_s-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"
"Food Great, But Unpleasant","This particular location did not enforce mask wearing and social distancing. The frozen yogurt and ice cream were the usual great. However, the experience was particularly unpleasant because the management allowed patrons to enter and be served without masks. That led to conflict and nastiness among patrons. We will not return so long as Brendy’s does not enforce mask wearing and social distancing. It’s for the sake of everyone else in the store - the employees and the patrons.","July 2020","Brendy's Yogurt & Ice Cream","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d895715-Reviews-Brendy_s_Yogurt_Ice_Cream-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","1.0","4.0"
"Perfect Mid-Afternoon","Since we are following social distancing guidelines carefully, we have found that the perfect time to dine is mid-afternoon.

Saiko has become a real favorite if ours. Emm is a particularly wonderful waitress.

"Gorgeous Outdoor Dining Overlooking the Inter-Coastal","Prime Catch has been a favorite of ours for years. Their outstanding seafood, wonderful views, great service, and reasonable prices made them stand out.

Last year Prime Catch closed to refurbish. They re-opened - just in time to close again for the pandemic.

Prime Catch is back open - better than ever. The middle of the afternoon is ideal for social distancing. Few diners and early bird starts at 4.

Marian was our wonderful waitress the other day. We can’t wait to come back.","July 2020","Prime Catch","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34094-d630494-Reviews-Prime_Catch-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html","Boynton Beach, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"

"Best Local Chinese","Lucy greeted us as always, albeit with a large plastic screen between her and us. Although we used to enjoy eating inside Shanghai City before the pandemic, we have limited ourselves to taking out.

Shanghai City continues to offer the same quality. We particularly like the hot and sour soup, the noodle dishes, and the various mixed seafood dishes.","July 2020","Shanghai City","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d2535932-Reviews-Shanghai_City-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"
"Superb Outdoor Dining","We were looking for a restaurant which would follow rules of social distancing and give four of us a large enough table so that two couples could dine together, and still observe six feet distance between the two couples.

Julian the manager patiently accommodated the four of us. Eric was our superb waiter. The four of us old friends enjoyed excellent cuisine, and followed social distancing rules in the midst of this awful coronavirus pandemic.","July 2020","Bistro Mezzaluna Restaurant","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34227-d466736-Reviews-Bistro_Mezzaluna_Restaurant-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Spectacular Local Art Museum","As members of the museum, we were invited to special early hours for members-only viewing. What a delight!

"Best Curbside Delivery","On the app I indicate I’m on my way to Greenwise. Magically, every time, the delivery person is wheeling my order to me as I’m pulling into the assigned spot.

"Best Chinese Restaurant in Palm Beach County","Kingsburg serves the best Chinese cuisine in Palm Beach County. Many travel from far and wide in the county, as I do, passing innumerable Chinese restaurants.

Kingsburg is worth the drive, wherever you live. Our personal favorites on their menu are their eggplant combinations. Each time we have gone to eat at Kingsburg before the pandemic, and each time we have done curbside delivery at Kingsburg, we have ordered one of their eggplant dishes. Over the years, we have tried many other entrees, all of them superb.","May 2020","Kingsburg Chinese Restaurant","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34094-d403449-Reviews-Kingsburg_Chinese_Restaurant-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html","Boynton Beach, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"
"Still Raving About Open Kitchen Cafe","Open Kitchen Cafe is a tiny restaurant in an office building. It offers superb home-cooked soups, empanadas, and daily specials. There are plenty of tables available in the lobby, so that one can easily enjoy social distancing lunch or a snack.

"Heaven in Hell","Among my many rave reviews of Twenty Twenty Grille, one of my favorites fantasized my dream arriving in heaven, where Chef Ron is in charge of the food and his wife Rhonda runs the floor.

Twenty Twenty Grille still offers heavenly food, even in the hell of this coronavirus pandemic. Taking out curbside, delivered to your door, or eating in, Twenty Twenty Grille provides fine dining excellence.

Indeed, Chef Ron and Rhonda rise even higher during this hellish time. They offer far more variety than during the olden days before the pandemic. If anything, Twenty Twenty Grille becomes even more outstanding, because Chef Ron and Rhonda have so brilliantly responded to this difficult time.","May 2020","TwentyTwenty Grille","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d6001844-Reviews-TwentyTwenty_Grille-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Rafina Always Terrific, Especially in the Pandemic","Rafina has always been one of my favorite restaurants, especially for its superb Greek tavern cuisine. During the pandemic, however, Rafina becomes even more outstanding. The food is the same. The Rafina difference is their huge outdoor dining area overlooking the lake. Well shaded and shielded from the common Florida rain showers, the outdoor area of Rafina is close to ideal.

Great food, terrific service, reasonable prices - as always - with a great outdoor dining area, especially outstanding during this pandemic crisis.","May 2020","Rafina Greek Taverna","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d8025411-Reviews-Rafina_Greek_Taverna-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"
"Best Pizza, Best Service","From far and near, diners pass many other pizzerias for Dominics I. It's the pizza, simple as that. Rich cheese topping, with every other possibility imaginable.

It's also the service, with the tone set by Tony, the owner and manager, and his frequent sidekick Mikey. But many of the waiters as well set this tone. My personal favorite is Mark, not just because I share his first name.

Recently, taking out one of Dominic's matchless pizzas, I was so happy to see my old friend Mark bringing out my pizza to my car.

Whoever delivers your pizza, at Dominic's, the pizza is the star.","May 2020","Dominic's I Pizza and Pasta","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d4437340-Reviews-Dominic_s_I_Pizza_and_Pasta-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"A Great Job Re-Opening Safely","Bradley's was always a favorite place of mine to meet friends for a beer and visit.

Coming out ever so carefully during this stage of the pandemic, it's good to see a restaurant which retains its pre-pandemic qualities, and yet maintains social distancing and cautious health protocols to keep us all safe. Each server wears a Bradley's facemask with a big ""B"" on it. Tables are spaced to keep some reasonable distance between diners. And the food and drink are good as always. Service is outstanding and friendly. Our server Kayli could not possibly have been more pleasant or welcoming.","May 2020","E.R.

"Trying Hard, But Not There","I wanted to give Jerusalem Grill another chance, especially because Ari reached out to me. Unfortunately, enthusiasm doesn't necessarily make good felafel and hummus.

The felafel was insufficiently fried for my taste. Each ball tasted like mush, rather than a harder outside. The hummus was creamy, too creamy.","May 2020","Jerusalem Grill","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d19395987-Reviews-Jerusalem_Grill-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","3.0","3.0"
"Back Open During the Pandemic, Still the Best Chinese in Palm Beach County","Especially during the pandemic, Kingsburg is worth the drive from anyplace in Palm Beach County. Long before the pandemic, we discovered Kingsburg. The twenty five minute drive was always worth while, passing dozens of other Chinese restaurants. Friendly service of huge portions of wonderful Chinese food was always their hallmark at Kingsburg. During this pandemic, they gladly bring your food out to your car at curbside. It's every bit as good, although not as much fun as sitting in the restaurant. Some day!

This week we enjoyed their wonderful hot and sour soup, egg roll, King's duck, and the sliced pork and eggplant. We did miss their signature stuffed eggplant, but the meal was superb.","April 2020","Kingsburg Chinese Restaurant","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34094-d403449-Reviews-Kingsburg_Chinese_Restaurant-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html","Boynton Beach, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"
"Even Curbside, Best Pizza and Salad","The best restaurants rise to their best in the pandemic crisis, certainly Dominic's I. Tony and his sidekick Mikey come through with their superb pizza and wonderful salads. A lot else is available on the menu, and they gladly bring out whatever you order to the curbside parking.

We shared a double spinach and roasted garlic pizza and a Greek salad recently, taken out from the curbside delivery. OK, it was not as good as sitting in the restaurant, but it was still top notch.","April 2020","Dominic's I Pizza and Pasta","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d4437340-Reviews-Dominic_s_I_Pizza_and_Pasta-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Outstanding Italian, even in the pandemic take-out mode","During this awful pandemic, the restaurants still open serve curbside delivery, ideally without requiring credit card signing on the spot. Trattoria Romana does it all just right. Two drive through lines of cars, with masked and gloved delivery people bringing terrific Italian food to your car. It will never equal the experience of dining in, but it's the same terrific food.

This week, we enjoyed the Caesar salad with extra anchovies, fettuccine bolognese, linguini congole, broccoli rabe, and spinach. A wonderful dinner.","May 2020","Trattoria Romana","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d663607-Reviews-Trattoria_Romana-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"New Reasons to Love Twenty Twenty Grille","In the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, Twenty Twenty has gotten even better. The quality of the fresh food Chef Ron sources, his superb cooking, and presentation could never have been better. What is different is that Chef Ron and his wife Rhonda are offering dishes not available at Twenty Twenty in the olden days BC (Before Coronavirus).

The other day, we thrilled at Chef Ron's incredible lasagna. Who knew? Lasagna is something which was never on the Twenty Twenty eat-in menu. But a family-size portion is now available for a bargain $30. The Weisheits were always willing to accommodate individual tastes and special requests, but for lasagna? My wife and I love lasagna, with the proviso that my wife doesn't like ricotta or cottage cheese in it. When I placed the order with Rhonda, I inquired if Chef Ron could make lasagna to my wife's taste. ""No problem!"" Rhonda replied.

The best lasagna we've ever eaten. Amazing Twenty Twenty!","April 2020","TwentyTwenty Grille","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d6001844-Reviews-TwentyTwenty_Grille-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Best Boca Greek","Taverna Kyma has finally arrived at my top rating. Recently, we ordered as curbside take out a Horiatiki salad, spanikopita, a grilled octopus appetizer, and moussaka. All together a wonderful meal for my wife and me. Indeed, it was as good as any taverna meal we have ever eaten, including on many trips to Greece. Although it is a long drive for us to Taverna Kyma, it's worth the trip.","April 2020","Taverna Kyma","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d644756-Reviews-Taverna_Kyma-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.0"
"Top Take Out Experience, Excellent Food","My wife and I enjoyed our orders of fettuccine bolognese and rigatoni Siciliana. Not only were both dishes superb and still hot after driving them home for 20 minutes, but Trattoria Romana also included two kinds of bread with bruschetta, bread sticks, and anisette rounds for dessert. Also accompanying the order was a generous helping of ground parmesan cheese to add as we wished.

The takeout experience at Trattoria Romana is fine tuned. One calls in an order and a credit card. At the designated time for pickup, one drives up to the side of the restaurant, where there are two lines for delivery. A courier gets your name, and brings the order to your car without a signature required or the swipe of a credit card. In this pandemic, health and safety are paramount. Trattoria Romana both serves excellent food, but follows best practice for keeping all of us safe.","April 2020","Trattoria Romana","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d663607-Reviews-Trattoria_Romana-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"Mediocre Chinese Food, but Open During the Pandemic","Crazy Wok is one of the few Chinese restaurants open for take out during the Coronavirus epidemic. That's the good part.

The food unfortunately is no more than average. If it weren't for the pandemic, I would never return.

My wife and I shared a large hot and sour soup, an order of moo shoo pork and the eggplant special dish. Nothing was awful, but at best it was mediocre.","March 2020","Crazy Wok","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34153-d921632-Reviews-Crazy_Wok-Coral_Springs_Broward_County_Florida.html","Coral Springs, Florida","restaurants","3.0","4.0"
"Great Take Out for South Asian, Indian-Pakistani Food","South Florida has lots of South Asian immigrants and their descendants, Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi. But there are few decent South Asian restaurants. During the many years I lived in London and during my monthlong travel throughout India, I developed a taste for South Asian cuisine. Living in Florida, my South Asian tastebuds have been in exile.

My tastebuds may have found a home at Bombay Cafe during the Coronavirus pandemic. Bombay Cafe does a really good job with take out. One can call in for an order, give a credit card over the phone, drive to Bombay Cafe, where they bring your order to the car.

Last night my wife and I shared orders of lamb biryani, lamb saag, and onion kulcha. The saffron rice base of the biryani and the pilaf rice with the lamb saag were up to top Indian standards, as were the sauces. Strangely, the weakest part of both dishes was the lamb, which was much tougher than it would have been in India or in the best South Asian restaurants in London. The onion kulcha (naan bread) was excellent.

We'll be back.","April 2020","Bombay Cafe Boca","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34088-d657457-Reviews-Bombay_Cafe_Boca-Boca_Raton_Florida.html","Boca Raton, Florida","restaurants","4.0","3.5"
