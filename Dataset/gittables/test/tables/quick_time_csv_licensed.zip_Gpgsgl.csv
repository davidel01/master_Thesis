"Great family lunch","We went for lunch and drinks. We didn't have a booking but we were lucky that they happened to have a space. The staff were friendly and helpful. We had the fish and chips which had such a light batter. The dessert were lovely as well.","April 2021","The Old Farm Inn","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g499476-d5011133-Reviews-The_Old_Farm_Inn-Dunstable_Bedfordshire_England.html","Dunstable, United Kingdom","restaurants","5.0","4.5"

"Lovely Restaurant with good COVID precautions","This is one of the restaurants I have felt most safe at during COVID times. The staff all wear visors at all times. All restaurant goers are asked to sanitize their hands being entering the restaurant. All menus are printed on paper and thrown away after use. Drinks are placed on the tray by the bar staff and then patrons are asked to take the drinks themselves. Staff are so welcoming and helpful. Couldn't ask for more.

The food is good and hearty with a limited but good menu. Lovely and fresh food.","October 2020","Prae","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186306-d10137404-Reviews-Prae-St_Albans_Hertfordshire_England.html","St. Albans, United Kingdom","restaurants","4.0","4.0"
"Birthday Meal","We dined in a pod for my dad's birthday. The temperature check and disinfectant pod as you enter is very good. However I saw many people by pass this and enter through the exit instead. As there is no one at the entrance it is easy for people to bypass.

The pod was heated when we entered and we were shown the heating controls so that we could ensure the pod was kept to a good temperature throughout our meal. When booking you are told it is only for 2 hours. We just about got in our 3 course meal. I think an additional half an hour would be the perfect duration.

The food was good and well cooked. Definitely recommend the lamb chop starters. The staff made a nice gesture of giving my dad a dessert with a candle and happy birthday written on the plate without being asked which was a nice touch.

The food and drinks are expensive and therefore I would not recommend it for the restaurant only however if you book for the pods then I think it you can just about justify the price.","November 2020","Ponsbourne Pods & Domes","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186305-d1381505-Reviews-Ponsbourne_Pods_Domes-Hertford_Hertfordshire_England.html","Hertford, United Kingdom","restaurants","4.0","4.0"

The pitta is the wrap with the meat off the heated skewers and the souvalaki is like a deconstructed kebab with chicken breast meat. The spicy chilli's really are spicy so take care. The tzatziki is also a must have!","October 2019","O Thanasis","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d929471-Reviews-O_Thanasis-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","restaurants","5.0","4.0"

"Such good food and service","Ate here and would have drinks several times while staying in Athens. Amazing view of the acropolis especially at night. The staff were so helpful and accomodating. A special shout-out needs to go to our waitress on our last night. I didn't get here name but she had really short hair. She was very helpful in recommending items of the menu but also just making us laugh and feeling welcome.

The sea bass was amazing the sauce with it was to die for. The chocolate souffle was also so good and make to order and so does take a while but it definitely worth the wait!","October 2019","Sin Athina","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3709115-Reviews-Sin_Athina-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","restaurants","5.0","4.5"
"4 night stay","Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights mid October.
The hotel was clean and modern. The rooms were a nice size with a balcony.
Rooms were made every morning with fresh towels.
Complimentary water placed in the mini bar fridge every morning.
Free drink token for each person given on arrival.
Did not have the breakfast but there is a nice cheap bakery opposite the hotel which is open from 6am.
Reception staff so helpful and accomodating.
There is also a roof terrace.
Such good value for money would 100% recommend.","October 2019","Be My Guest Athens","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d12865158-Reviews-Be_My_Guest_Athens-Athens_Attica.html","Athens, Greece","hotels","4.0","4.5"
"Birthday Meal","Went to Tawa as a family for a birthday meal. For ages we have been looking for a good Indian in the area with a variety of dishes different from the norm. This restaurant certainly delivered.

For starters we tried a variety of dishes. Definitely recommend the Sri Lankan lamb rolls and the calamari.

For mains we ordered off the special section and had the monkfish, the green chicken curry and the venison. The meats in all the dishes were cooked to perfection with great sauces to match. We also had the smoked aubergine mash and desi style salad as vegetarian dishes. These were such different dishes and an absolute delight.

To finish off we had one of the stand out dishes for those with a sweet tooth which was the chocolate samosas. We have never had a desert like this at an Indian restaurant and it was a treat to behold.

The drink selection was especially good as well with a variety of gin and tonics and craft beers.

The decor and layout of the restaurant is really well done. With fabulous murals hand painted on the walls of different aspects of Indian and Bollywood culture. The staff were very helpful and welcoming throughout the meal and did not rush us as sometimes happens at some restaurants. There was some nice instrumental Indian music in the background which did not overwhelm and allowed conversation to flow at the table.

Overall the meal was absolutely fabulous and we will definitely be back again!","July 2019","Tawa-Roadside Indian","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1076910-d17648424-Reviews-Tawa_Roadside_Indian-Shefford_Bedfordshire_England.html","Shefford, United Kingdom","restaurants","5.0","5.0"
"Great Beach, Food and Staff","Booked 2 weeks before we were due to come out. It was to celebrate my Mum's 50th Birthday. The staff could not do enough to be helpful. There was a good range of food and an option to eat in the a la carte restaurant or buffet restaurant. I liked that there was no limit on how many times we could eat at either. A great selection at lunch time as well. The burgers really did live up to the review of others. Did 2 session of Yoga on the beach which were included in the AI activities. The instructor was very knowledgeable and patient. My brother is gluten and dairy intolerant and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate this. The beach butler service was above and beyond what I expected. As well as drinks they delivered food as well when requested and things like being able to have lunch on the beach was what made the experience extra special. We went snorkelling at the hotel. Beach shoes are a nice to have. It was good to have the bottom glass boat and snorkeling trip included. The staff knew the best stops and we were even able to see turtles.","June 2018","Tamassa Resort","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g612353-d736372-Reviews-Tamassa_Resort-Bel_Ombre.html","Mauritius","hotels","5.0","5.0"
"Morning Trip up Le Morne Brabrant","I decided to book this for my mum and dad to celebrate their 50th Birthdays. I probably did not appreciate how steep the second half was going to be. I cannot thank Bryn enough for making this a special trip that is one that none of the family will ever forget. My mum found the second half very scary due to the height and was not sure if she was going to be able to do it. However with Bryn's patience and that of the rest of the group and his guidance we were able to complete it. The views were absolutely stunning and Bryn really captured this with his pictures. I recommend doing this trip with Bryn and definitely not on your own!","June 2018","Explorers Mauritius","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g488105-d10730260-Reviews-Explorers_Mauritius-Le_Morne.html","Mauritius","attractions","5.0","5.0"
"Great Free Tour slightly disappointed with the Castle Tour","The free tour was amazing and well worth tipping for! Katerina our tour guide was informative entertaining and very humorous! It enabled us to see the majority of Prague in one day and was well worth doing. Extra information about each stop was also given to give us the opportunity to return to the stops to explore in more time if we so wished!

The castle tour was slightly more disappointing ad we had a different tour guide to the free one. It was a tour for which we had to pay up front. I don't know if this is why it was not as good as the free one as the tour guide did not have to work for tips as people had already payed. I didn't find the guide as entertaining or as enthusiastic but it was still much better than attempting to explore the castle myself. It was still good but i don't think it was good value for money!","July 2014","SANDEMANs NEW Europe - Prague","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d1440169-Reviews-SANDEMANs_NEW_Europe_Prague-Prague_Bohemia.html","Prague, Czech Republic","attractions","5.0","5.0"
