"2006","The Temple of Hope",""
"2007","{{nowrap|The Temple of Forgiveness}}","David Best took over the Temple building duties for what he thought would be one last time. Best stated that after 2007, it was time to hand the Temple over to the community."
"2008","Basura Sagrada","The ""Basura Sagrada"" (Spanish for ""sacred trash"") was a collaboration of Shrine and Tucker Teutsch 3.0, built with the extensive help of their friends and the greater Burning Man community."
"2009","Fire of Fires","This Temple was built in Austin, Texas."
"2010","The Temple of Flux","This Temple was designed and orchestrated by artists Rebecca Anders, Jess Hobbs and Peter (pk.) Kimelman who formed the Flux Foundation. This group was notable for drawing from a broad section of the Burning Man community, including the large-scale sound camps and other existing BM art groups. The Flux Foundation has since continued to make large-scale public art outside Burning Man. The Temple of Flux broke from tradition and was highly abstract in nature, appearing as a series of landforms with canyon and cave-like spaces."
"2011","The Temple of Transition","This was the first Temple built in Reno, Nevada. The International Arts Megacrew, helmed by Chris ""Kiwi"" Hankins, Diarmaid ""Irish"" Horkan and Ian ""Beave"" Beaverstock returned to a more traditional style. The Temple of Transition took the form of a 120-foot tiered, hexagonal central tower, surrounded by five 58-foot tiered, hexagonal towers. The towers were vaulted and lofty, cut with a profusion of gothic style arches."
"2012","The Temple of Juno","With the 2012 Temple came the return of David Best. The Temple of Juno incorporated a large central tower with central altar space, sitting within a 150' x 150' walled courtyard lined with benches, accessed from four entrances. Intricately cut wooden panels and detailed shapes covered the courtyard walls as well as the interior space and altars."
"2013","The Temple of Whollyness","This temple was created by The Otic Oasis team, led by architect and artist Gregg Fleishman, Terry Lightning ""Clearwater III"" Gross, and Melissa ""Syn"" Barron. This was the first Temple built without nails, bolts, adhesives, or fasteners of any kind. This Temple incorporated a massive 17-ton black basalt Inuksuk sculpture created by artist, James LaFemina to act as the central altar. Conceptual artist and composer, Aaron 'Taylor' Kuffner, who debuted at Burning Man with the 2011 Temple of Transition, returned to contribute musical elements with a different execution of the Gamelatron."
"2014","The Temple of Grace","Following the sudden withdrawal of chosen 2014 Temple builder Ross Asselstine, who was to build the Temple of Descendants, David Best came out of retirement a third time to build his eighth Temple. The Temple of Grace was intended to be a spiritual and sacred space for memorials, reflection, celebration, and to commemorate life transitions. The structure incorporated a central interior dome within a graceful curved body made of wood and steel. Again, it had intricately cut wooden panels for the exterior and interior skin. Eight altars surrounded the temple inside a low-walled courtyard, creating a large exterior grounds for the community."
"2015","The Temple of Promise","This temple was created by Dreamers Guild and built primarily in Alameda, California. The temple welcomed participants through an archway soaring {{convert|97|ft|m}} overhead. As the path continued to curve, it opened into the contemplative altar and the heart of the Temple: a grove of three sculpted trees. The branches were initially bare, and participants wrote messages on long strips of cloth and attached them to the trees, creating the gentle shade of weeping willows, increasing as the week progressed."
"2016","The Temple{{dagger}}","David Best came out of retirement yet again to build a pagoda style temple. This year the wooden pieces were cut by hand without the use of a CNC machine."
"2017","The Temple{{dagger}}","Designed by Steven Brummond, Marisha Farnsworth and Mark Sinclair (who acted as leads on prior David Best temples); two are architects and one is a structural engineer. It stood {{convert|80|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|120|ft|m}} across. They milled the lumber themselves, and most of the build was at a sawmill in Sonora, California."
"2018","Galaxia","This temple was designed by architect Arthur Mamou-Mani and was built in two locations; Reno, Nevada, and Oakland, California. Galaxia was shaped by 20 timber trusses converging as a spiral towards one point in the sky. The triangular trusses formed different paths towards a central space holding a giant 3D printed mandala at the center. The timber modules start large enough to hold small alcoves in which people could interact with the structure in peace. As participants walked through the path, the timber modules lifted up and became thinner towards the sky as they reached the central mandala."
"2019","The Temple of Direction","Designed by Geordie Van Der Bosch. This temple was designed to reflect the Torii Gates at the Fushimi Shrines in Japan. It was chosen for its relative simplicity after Galaxia in 2018, which proved incredibly complex to assemble on-playa."
