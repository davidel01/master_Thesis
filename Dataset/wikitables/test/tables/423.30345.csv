Two farmsteads were struck southwest of Wayne, and many sheds and barns were either damaged or destroyed. Two homes in this area sustained EF3-strength damage as well. The tornado moved into the east side of Wayne, causing severe damage to a softball complex, damaging farm equipment at a dealership, and either damaging or completely destroying many large industrial metal buildings at an industrial park, some of which were either badly mangled or completely reduced to rubble. At this point, the tornado had reached its peak intensity and a few pockets of EF4-strength damage were noted. It then took direct aim on the Wayne Municipal Airport, where two hangars were flattened, several private aircraft were flipped and destroyed, and the AWOS was shredded and scattered over unknown distances. The tornado then caused EF2-type damage to another farmstead before crossing into Dixon County, where it narrowed, weakened, and eventually dissipated after causing roof, window, and siding damage to a few more houses, overturning a camper, and either heavily damaging or destroying a grain bin and numerous farm buildings, as well as farm equipment. Many trees were downed and crops were flattened along the path. Fifteen people were injured by the tornado.",""
