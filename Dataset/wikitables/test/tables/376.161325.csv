"Laura (Bianca King) is an expectant mother for the third time. She and her husband Jeffrey (JC Tiuseco) look for a yaya to take care of their new baby. But Laura has had enough of those attractive yayas who end up having an affair with her husband so she exercises more caution in choosing the next one. Ultimately, she chooses one who is way old to be her husband's mother. But her new babysitter will not stay long enough as she is killed by the resentful ghost of a former babysitter of a family who lived in the same house several years before Laura and Jeffrey. The ghost murderer named Shirley (Sam Pinto) made Laura take her on board as a babysitter. Soon after Laura gives birth, Shirley takes her baby away. Story has it that Shirley was a babysitter who was impregnated by her employer and was forced to have an abortion. Bothered by her conscience, she hanged herself.","Laura (Bianca King) is an expectant mother for the third time.
