However, at the end of the second round-robin stage, Auto Esporte judicially contested the referee of one of their matches. This caused a paralyzation of the championship, with the third round-robin stage not being realized and the FPF (Federação Paraibana de Futebol) declaring Botafogo (winner of first round-robin stage) and Treze (winner of the second round-robin stage) state champions of 1975.|group=""note""}}"
